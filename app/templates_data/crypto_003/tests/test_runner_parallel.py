"""Real-parallelism smoke test for the multi-ticker analysis flow.

Launches 5 tickers concurrently with cap=5 and verifies they truly run
in parallel (not serialized through a thread pool, lock, or the graph
pool's queue). Each fake propagate() does 1 second of (sleep) work and
records its actual start/end wall-clock window. After gather, we check:

  1. Total elapsed wall time ≈ one run's duration (not N×).
  2. All 5 (start, end) windows overlap — a single instant exists when
     every run was in flight.

Run with: pytest tests/test_runner_parallel.py
