    The Telegraph SDK uses synchronous HTTP under the hood, so we offload
    the API call to a worker thread to keep PTB's event loop responsive.

    `edit_path` enables in-place updates so `/refresh` keeps the same
    shareable URL while replacing the content — without it, every
    refresh creates a new page (Telegraph appends `-2`/`-3` suffixes on
    title collision) and old shared links go stale. When `edit_path` is
    provided we try `edit_page` first. A *transient* failure on edit
    (`ConnectionError`/`Timeout`) gets one retry; if it still fails, we
    return None (don't fall through to `create_page` — that would leak a
    new URL and defeat the whole edit-in-place fix). A *non-transient*
    failure on edit (page deleted, auth drift, oversized content) falls
    through to `create_page` so a broken edit-target doesn't block the
    publish entirely. The caller's cache-hygiene gate ensures a None
    return doesn't poison the cache.

    Resilience:
    - One retry with 1s backoff on transient network errors
      (ConnectionError / Timeout) — applied uniformly to both edit and
      create paths via `_call_with_transient_retry`.
    - Failure log records input/cleaned HTML sizes + exception class so
      future failures can be triaged without re-instrumenting.
