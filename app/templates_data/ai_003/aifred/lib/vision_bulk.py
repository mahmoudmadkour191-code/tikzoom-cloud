"""Headless bulk-describe orchestration — the single source of truth for
"give every undescribed vision event a VLM description".

The work is always the same: take motion/face events that have no
description yet, collapse near-duplicate frames into clusters (pHash +
time-bucket, see :mod:`vision_cluster`) so the VLM runs once per
*happening* instead of once per frame, describe the representative of
each cluster, and apply that text to all cluster members.

Three callers share this one function so the logic lives in exactly one
place:

* the Casus UI bulk button (passes callbacks to drive its progress bar
  and cancel flag),
* the nightly garbage-collection task (headless, no callbacks),
* the on-demand path from the conversational query tool.

State integration is kept out of here entirely — callers bridge progress
and cancellation via the two optional callbacks.
