"""Analysis-execution pipeline + cancel + digest scheduling.

Split out of `handlers/callbacks.py` to keep that module focused on
inline-button routing (the `button_callback` dispatcher) and picker UI.
Public surface:

- `_run_analysis_for_ticker` — single-ticker analysis (used by `/watch`,
  `/refresh`, and the watchlist picker Done button)
- `run_user_digest`, `register_digest_job`, `cancel_digest_job` — daily
  digest fan-out + scheduling
- `_handle_get_full_md`, `_handle_cancel_analysis`, `_handle_digest_cancel`
  — callback-query handlers dispatched from `button_callback`
- `_full_report_keyboard` — keyboard builder reused by `/history`

Shared module state:
- `_run_semaphore` — global concurrency cap, lazy-bound to the running
  asyncio loop on first acquire.
