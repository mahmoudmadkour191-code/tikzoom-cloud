# AIfred Intelligence

**Autonomous AI Assistant with Tool Use, Message Hub, Multi-Agent Debates, Vision/Camera Surveillance & Local LLM Inference**

AIfred Intelligence is a fully-featured AI assistant running locally on your own hardware. It autonomously manages emails, appointments, documents, databases and camera feeds — with function calling, persistent memory, multi-agent debates and on-device VLM analysis. No cloud dependency, full data sovereignty.

**📺 [View Example Showcases](https://peuqui.github.io/AIfred-Intelligence/)** - Exported chats: Multi-Agent debates, Chemistry, Math, Coding, and Web Research.

> ⭐ **If AIfred is useful for you, please star this repo.** Self-hosters easily forget — but stars are the main signal that tells me people are actually using this. It directly affects whether I keep building.

---

## 🔗 Complex Workflows (Tool Chains)

The real value doesn't come from individual tools, but from **chains** that AIfred works through autonomously across multiple plugins — from **any channel**: browser, voice terminal (FreeEcho.2), Telegram, Discord, email.

**Example (real, tested end-to-end):** You photograph a business card with your phone and say — typed or by voice:

> *"Analyze this business card, extract all the data, create the contact in Google, check next week for a free morning, book a two-hour appointment, and send me the photo along with the contact details via Telegram."*

AIfred runs this as one continuous chain:

1. **👁️ Vision** — the VLM reads the card (name, phone, email, address, web) directly from the image
2. **📇 Google Contacts** — creates the contact in structured form (`google_contacts_create`)
3. **📅 Google Calendar** — **first** checks the time window for free slots (`list_events`) and **only then** books the appointment — it also recognizes an already-existing appointment and asks back instead of creating a duplicate
4. **📤 Telegram with attachment** — sends you the **photo of the card** as an attachment plus the contact details as text — without knowing your chat ID (owner default)

All local, a single prompt, no intermediate click. Files from the conversation (uploaded images, PDFs/plots generated in the sandbox) can be sent as attachments over **any** channel, session-isolated.

**Prerequisites & knobs:**
- **Security tier:** Creating tools (create contact/appointment, run code) require `WRITE_DATA` and up. In the browser you always have this; external channels are raised as needed in the **Plugin Manager** (the elevation is deliberately only possible there — no sender can grant itself rights). See [Security Architecture](#-security-architecture)
- **Vision + tool chains:** For reliable tool calls on the image path, **turn off thinking mode for vision** (the 🧠 icon on the vision LLM; the 💭 icon → reasoning-prompt injection may stay enabled). Otherwise reasoning models with speculative decoding (MoE/MTP) swallow tool calls after thinking

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Autonomous Capabilities (Function Calling / Tool Use)

The LLM autonomously decides which tools to use — OpenAI-compatible tool infrastructure with plugin system:

- **Message Hub — AIfred as Communication Central**: AIfred monitors external channels and processes incoming messages autonomously. **Runs headless** — no browser needed. Channel plugins listen in the background, the LLM processes and replies via Discord/Email independently. The web UI is only needed for initial setup (credentials, plugin toggles) and optional monitoring. **Unified plugin system**: drop a `.py` file into `plugins/channels/` or `plugins/tools/` — auto-discovered, no code changes needed. **Built-in channels**: E-Mail Monitor (IMAP IDLE push-based + SMTP auto-reply), Discord (bot with channel + DM support, `/clear` command). **Plugin Manager** UI modal to enable/disable any plugin at runtime (moves files to `disabled/`). Pipeline: **Channel listener** → **Envelope normalization** → **SQLite routing table** → **AIfred engine call** (with full toolkit incl. web research, calendar check) → **Auto-reply** (optional, per-channel toggle). Agent routing: address Sokrates or Salomo by name. **Note**: Hub messages are processed without browser State — progress bars, live streaming and sources HTML are not available for Hub-processed messages; this is by design, not a limitation. See [Architecture & Setup](docs/en/architecture/message-hub.md)
- **Email Integration**: Read, search, and send emails via IMAP/SMTP. Sending requires explicit user confirmation (draft → review → confirm). Credentials via `.env` or UI modal
- **EPIM Database Integration**: Full CRUD access to the [EssentialPIM](https://www.essentialpim.com/) Firebird 2.5 database — the LLM autonomously searches, creates, updates and deletes calendar events, contacts, notes, todos and password entries. Automatic name-to-ID resolution, anti-hallucination guardrails, 7-day date reference
- **Workspace (Files & Documents)**: Upload documents (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, LibreOffice, TXT, MD, CSV), automatic chunking and embedding in ChromaDB via **BGE-M3** (8192-token context, 1024-dim, multilingual). Token-accurate chunking with the local Qwen3 tokenizer. LLM can autonomously browse, read (PDFs page-by-page), write, edit, **rename** and delete files on disk — then index them into the vector database for semantic search with **folder filter** (`search_documents(query=…, folder="bibel/Schlachter")`) and **chunk-neighbor retrieval** (each hit returns its immediate neighbor chunks for full surrounding context). Document Manager UI with preview, **bulk-folder index** (one click for an entire tree), live file count per folder, **orphan cleanup** (find indexed entries whose source file is gone) and toast-based feedback for terminal status messages
- **Sandboxed Code Execution**: LLM writes and runs Python code in isolated subprocess. Supports numpy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, scipy, sklearn. Interactive HTML/JS visualizations (Plotly 3D, Canvas games, simulations) directly in chat
- **Agent Long-Term Memory**: Per-agent persistent memory via ChromaDB (BGE-M3 embeddings) — agents autonomously store insights, combined recall (10 recent + semantic search), session pinning. Memory Browser for inspection and cleanup. Incognito mode (🔒)
- **Tool-Output Token Cap**: Single tool result is capped to keep `system + history + memory + tool_result ≤ 75%` of the active model's context window — guarantees the model has 25% headroom for its answer. JSON-aware truncation: result-list responses are shortened from the end (with `_truncated` marker) so the model still sees structured data
- **Automatic Web Research**: AI decides autonomously when research is needed. Multi-API (SearXNG primary, Tavily + Brave as fallback) with automatic scraping and LLM-based URL ranking. Every research runs fresh — no result cache, so time-sensitive answers (weather, prices, news) never come from an earlier search
- **More tool plugins**: **Audio Player** (play local audio files — WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC), **Scheduler** (LLM creates cron/interval/one-shot jobs), **System Monitor** (CPU, RAM, GPU, disk, temperature), **Google Suite** (OAuth 2.0 for Google Calendar + Contacts), **Translator** (DeepL, 30+ languages, auto source-language detection), **Narrator** (whole documents → one MP3 via TTS, engine/voice configurable per plugin gear icon; multi-voice audio dramas via `[SPEAKER]:` markers — one voice per speaker, any number of speakers), **Bible** (exact passage lookup + thematic vector search), **Judaica** (Jewish source corpus: Tanakh, Talmud, Mishnah, Midrash, Halacha, commentaries), **Calculator** (`calculate`), plus `web_fetch` (URL extraction) and `store_memory` (agent memory)
- **Full plugin overview:** [Available Plugins](docs/en/guides/plugins-overview.md)

### 🎩 Multi-Agent System

- **Multi-Agent Debate System**: AIfred + Sokrates + Salomo + Vision + unlimited custom agents
- **Custom Agents**: Name, emoji, role, bilingual prompts (DE/EN), own long-term memory. Agent Editor in UI
- **Generic Agent Core**: All per-agent settings (model, sampling, thinking mode, context size, TTS voice) live in a single `agent_tuning` map — custom agents are first-class citizens. A newly created agent automatically gets its own settings row, sampling row and context column in the UI; no code changes, no hardcoded agent lists
- **5 Discussion Modes**: Standard, Critical Review, Auto-Consensus, Tribunal, Symposion (with reflection layer from round 2)
- **Voice-Based Mode Switching**: Switch modes, agents, and research settings via natural language — "Start Tribunal", "Switch to Sokrates", "Use deep research and discuss X". The Automatik-LLM detects mode switches, persistent agent changes ("I want to keep talking to Pater Tuck"), and combined commands in a single utterance. Works from browser, voice terminal (FreeEcho.2), and all channels
- **Direct Addressing**: Address any agent by name — also via Telegram, Discord and Email through Message Hub
- **User Mapping**: External identities (Telegram ID, email address) mapped to AIfred usernames (`data/user_mapping.json`) — AIfred recognizes you across all channels
- **6-Layer Prompt System**: Identity + Reasoning + Multi-Agent + Task + Memory + Personality

### ⚙️ LLM Infrastructure

- **Multi-Backend Support**: llama.cpp via llama-swap (GGUF), Ollama (GGUF), vLLM (AWQ), TabbyAPI (EXL2), Cloud APIs (Qwen, DeepSeek, Claude)
- **Distributed Inference (RPC)**: Run models across multiple machines over LAN via llama.cpp RPC
- **Automatic Context Calibration**: VRAM-aware context sizing per backend with greedy cascade (fill the fastest compute class first, spill to the next), Binary Search, RoPE scaling, tensor-split optimization. Hardware-agnostic — no hand-tuned GPU lists in code
  - **2D Matrix Picker**: explicit per-cell selection of which variants to calibrate — `(VLM × TTS engine)` grid plus a "no VLM / no TTS" row. Each cell becomes a separate llama-swap profile `<base>-vlm-<key>-tts-<engine>` that the chat-path resolver picks up automatically
  - **Stress Burn-In**: VLM + TTS VRAM footprints are measured under load (worst-case bilingual TTS synthesis, VLM context-fill prewarm) instead of being hand-coded. Results cached in `data/vlm_vram_cache.json` / `data/tts_vram_cache.json`
  - **Side-Channel Capacity Guard**: Before writing a `<base>-tts-<engine>-vlm-<key>` combo profile, the calibrator checks whether `tts_reserve + vlm_reserve` fits the shared side-channel GPU. Combos that would OOM at runtime are rejected with a clear "Profile NOT written" message — no stale traps in the YAML
  - **Persistent Failure Tracking**: The picker shows three states per cell — green dot (calibrated), red dot (tried but failed, with reason), empty (never tried). Failure reasons: `capacity_exceeded`, `model_too_big`, `projection_failed`, `probe_unrecoverable`. A successful recalibration clears the red dot automatically
  - **Strategy SSOT**: [docs/de/architecture/calibration-strategy.md](docs/de/architecture/calibration-strategy.md) (German) is the authoritative algorithmic reference; algorithm + (optional) AI agent path both read from it
- **Thinking Mode**: Chain-of-Thought reasoning (Qwen3, NemoTron, QwQ)
- **History Compression**: Intelligent compression at 70% context utilization for unlimited conversations
- **Automatic Model Lifecycle**: Zero-config — new models auto-discovered on start, removed models auto-cleaned
- **Sampling Parameters**: Per-agent Temperature, Top-K, Top-P, Min-P, Repeat-Penalty (Auto/Manual)
- **Performance**: Direct-IO for fast model loading, details in [Model Parameter Docs](docs/en/benchmarks/model-params.md)

### 🎤 Voice Interface

- **STT** via Whisper Docker container (dual-device: CPU permanent + GPU with TTL auto-unload, Web-UI for model/settings management). Uploads route by size: mic dictations stay on CPU, large files (meetings) go to the GPU engine (best free card, UUID-pinned) with duration estimation via ffprobe — hopeless runs are rejected upfront, long ones ask for confirmation, and if all GPUs are occupied a visible CPU fallback kicks in. Before an LLM cold start the GPU worker is released (a running transcription gets a grace period first)
- **Meeting pipeline**: large audio uploads are transcribed in their original language (`language=auto`) into a workspace file (persistent chat bubble with a clickable link), then translated on demand via DeepL (`translate_file`) and narrated to a phone-friendly MP3 (`narrate_file`) — each step leaves a file you can inspect or redo
- **TTS engines**: Qwen3-TTS (local, voice cloning, streaming), XTTS v2 (voice cloning), Fish-Speech S2 Pro (voice cloning, streaming), MOSS-TTS 1.7B, DashScope Qwen3-TTS (cloud streaming), Edge TTS, Piper, eSpeak. Per-agent TTS configuration (voice, speed, pitch, on/off per agent), gapless realtime audio playback, per-bubble audio regenerate button
- **Stress Burn-In**: TTS engines are measured under a worst-case bilingual synthesis load on first use. Peak VRAM is cached in `data/tts_vram_cache.json` — calibrations and live inference use the measured value plus a fixed headroom instead of hand-tuned reserves
- **FreeEcho.2 Voice Terminal**: Dedicated voice interface for Echo Dot 2 hardware (custom firmware). Wake word detection, immediate browser flush (user question visible within 500ms after STT), deferred TTS container management (parallel GPU cleanup during LLM inference)

### 👁️ Vision

- **Frame-Source Pipeline**: Plug-in based — drop a `frame_source` plugin under `plugins/vision_sources/`, it auto-registers with the FrameHub. Built-in: webcam (V4L2 + MJPEG passthrough), file-system snapshot. Each source has a per-camera **alias + resolution + briefing text** stored as single-source-of-truth
- **RTSP / IP / Wi-Fi Cameras**: `rtsp_source` — configured via `rtsp_cameras` in settings, not auto-scanned. Credentials never live in the config: user/password come from the **CredentialBroker** (`.env`), and the full `rtsp://…` URL is assembled only at connect time, never logged, stored or shown to the LLM
- **Live Preview Modal**: Multi-source popup with MJPEG streams, per-camera resolution toggle, manual snapshot, **teleprompter overlay** for the LLM's last analysis. Stream eviction + retry on V4L2 lock contention
- **VLM Power Toggle**: VLM can be loaded on demand (`vision_mode=on-demand`) or kept resident (`vision_mode=live`). `vision_mode=off` disables vision entirely
- **Side-Channel Routing**: Calibration writes a separate `<base>-vlm-<key>` llama-swap profile that holds the VLM's measured VRAM on the second-highest-compute-class GPU. Chat-path resolver picks that profile automatically when vision is active — the main LLM has the correct cushion in place
- **Per-Camera Briefing**: Each camera carries its own role/identity prompt (e.g. "hallway near front door"), prepended to the VLM call so analyses are context-aware
- **Plugin Settings**: Dedicated route `/vision-settings` for sources, FPS, face thresholds, retention, model choice

### 🔍 Vigilantia (Camera Surveillance)

The Vision pipeline's watch mode — turns AIfred into a continuous monitoring agent. Code under `plugins/tools/vision/`; detailed docs: [Vision/Vigilantia plugin](docs/en/guides/plugins/vision.md).

- **Master Eye + Background Watchers**: Per-source watcher threads (motion + face detect + optional VLM). Watcher state survives browser disconnects — runs in the Message Hub worker process, not the Reflex state
- **Motion Detection**: OpenCV background subtraction (MOG2) with configurable min-area-ratio, warmup frames, event throttling. Saves event frame to disk on trigger
- **Zone Masks (ignore / GDPR-blackout / ROI)**: Per-source painted grid, three types mixable in one frame — red ignores motion (swaying trees), black blacks out pixels before save *and* before the VLM (GDPR: street/neighbour never on disk), green = region-of-interest (only that area is watched). Motion threshold is relative to the observed area. Painted in a standalone canvas editor over the **live MJPEG**; saves take effect live (no restart), with a "mask active" toggle for quick A/B checks
- **PTZ Control (ONVIF)**: Minimal ONVIF client (raw SOAP over `requests`, no extra dependency) for pan/tilt/zoom cameras — `continuous_move`/`stop`/`absolute_move`/`goto_preset` + `aim_at_offset`; auth via the CredentialBroker. Engine present, UI/tool wiring pending
- **Face Recognition**: `insightface` (`buffalo_l` model) with **configurable execution provider** (CUDA, CPU, CoreML). Continuous-detection mode for low-FPS streams. Known/unsure/unknown classification via cosine similarity against the **Personarium** (identity database). Per-face retention policy
- **Personarium**: Identity-management modal — enroll faces from snapshots, name + ID + group, multi-pose enrollment wizard (frontal + 4 angles), edit + delete. Faces are stored as ONNX-embedded vectors, not raw images
- **Casus Event Browser**: Modal with filter (type, source, face-id), pagination, per-event thumbnail. Click a thumbnail → full-image **slideshow** (arrow keys / buttons, left = older, right = newer); manual refresh button. Single-event **VLM-Analyse** on demand (asks the configured VLM "what's happening here"). Bulk-Mode: select N events → background worker runs VLM on each with progress + cancel
- **pHash Dedup + Cluster Mode**: Perceptual hash on every saved frame, near-duplicate events collapsed into clusters (`cluster_id` in the SQLite schema). Cluster-Mode toggle in the Casus shows one card per cluster instead of N near-identical motion events. Cluster knobs (`VISION_CLUSTER_BUCKET_SECONDS`, `VISION_CLUSTER_PHASH_THRESHOLD`) live in `config.py`
- **Auto-Describe (nightly + on-demand)**: Background surveillance keeps the VLM off; scene descriptions are backfilled, clustered (one call per happening, not per frame). The nightly garbage collection (03:00) describes all still-undescribed events *before* pruning — chronicle complete by morning. `vision_query_events` with `describe=true` backfills just the queried window on demand for fresh same-day data. Shared orchestration: `run_bulk_describe` in [vision_bulk.py](aifred/lib/vision_bulk.py)
- **VRAM Pre-Check before Bulk-Worker**: Bulk VLM-Analyse aborts cleanly if the side-channel GPU doesn't have enough headroom for the configured VLM batch — no half-completed run with OOM mid-stream
- **AI Cameras (Edge-AI) as trigger, own detectors decide**: Cameras with on-device person/vehicle/animal detection (`profile: ai_camera`) are polled (`GetAiState`) as a cheap pre-filter; the decision is then made by AIfred's own YOLO/InsightFace — the camera's claim alone never raises an alert. Per-class confirmation policy (`EDGE_AI_CONFIRM`): person/vehicle require own-YOLO confirmation (kills IR false-positives), animal trusts the camera (nano-YOLO is weak there). One multi-class YOLO inference confirms **and** counts. Capability-driven, not model-driven: snap/dual-lens/PTZ are declared as `rtsp_cameras` fields, brand-specifics isolated in `vision_snap`/`reolink_ai`. Details: [Vision plugin doc](docs/en/guides/plugins/vision.md)
- **Aggregated, named alerts + counting**: All faces of one happening collapse into one alert per band — every recognised person named (uncapped), unknowns counted; the VLM is handed the names so it addresses each by name. Persons/vehicles counted exactly
- **One snap/AI session per camera**: Watcher polling + on-demand snapshot + multipose preview share a single Reolink session per device (`vision_snap`, keyed by host) — fresh full-resolution snaps via the Snap API (no RTSP buffer lag), clean logout on shutdown, no "max session" stacking
- **Vigilantia Feed Live-Card**: Inline UI card on the main page showing the last N events from any watcher source, refreshed via the 500ms heartbeat (no extra timers, no per-tick state delta — see [_vigilantia_feed_mixin.py](aifred/state/_vigilantia_feed_mixin.py))
- **Vision Tools**: The LLM has tools for `vision_list_sources`, `vision_rescan_sources`, `vision_snapshot`, `vision_analyze`, `vision_enroll_face`, `vision_start_watch`, `vision_stop_watch`, `vision_list_active_watches`, `vision_query_events` — autonomous use during conversations

### 📷 Image Analysis (Chat)

- **Image Attachments**: Drop images into the chat, interactive crop modal, multi-image messages (up to 5 per turn)
- **Multimodal LLMs**: DeepSeek-OCR, Qwen3-VL, Ministral-3, llama.cpp's `--mmproj` for compatible models
- **VL Follow-Up**: Visual Q&A continuation across multiple turns referencing the same image
- **2-Model Architecture**: Dedicated Vision-LLM for image understanding, results passed to the Main-LLM as structured JSON

### 🔒 Security Architecture

Multi-layered security — enforced at the framework level, not in plugins:

- **5-Level Permission System** (Tier 0–4): READONLY → COMMUNICATE → WRITE_DATA → WRITE_SYSTEM → ADMIN. Every tool has a fixed tier. Colored tier badges (T0–T3) on each tool in the Agent Editor. Per-channel security tier configurable in Plugin Manager — control what each channel (FreeEcho.2, Discord, Email, Telegram) is allowed to do
- **Inbound Sanitization**: HTML strip, zero-width character removal, NFC normalization of all incoming messages
- **Delimiter Defense**: External messages wrapped in `<external_message>` tags with sender, channel and trust level
- **Security Boundary Prompt**: LLM instructed to not execute commands from external messages
- **Rule of Two**: Write-tier tools blocked from external channels (no file deletion via email)
- **Rate Limiting**: Max tool calls per time window per channel
- **Chain Depth Limit**: Max 10 tool calls per request (prevents infinite loops)
- **Output Sanitization**: Secret patterns (API keys, passwords) stripped from tool responses
- **Credential Broker**: Plugins never access secrets directly — only via `broker.get()`
- **Audit Log**: Every tool call logged (timestamp, channel, tool, tier, result)

> **Details:** [Security Architecture](docs/en/architecture/security.md)

### 🖥️ UI & Session Management

- **Central Settings Modal** (☰ hamburger menu): Agent Editor (metadata, TTS, prompts), Memory Browser (per-agent with type filter), Database Management (ChromaDB documents — browse, delete individual or clear all), Plugin Manager, Audit Log
- **User Authentication**: Username + password login with whitelist-based registration
- **Session Management**: Chat list with LLM-generated titles, session switching, persistent history
- **Share Chat**: Export as portable HTML file (KaTeX fonts inline, TTS audio embedded, works offline)
- **LaTeX & Chemistry**: KaTeX for math formulas, mhchem for chemistry
- **HTML Preview**: AI-generated HTML code opens directly in browser
- **Harmony-Template Support**: GPT-OSS-120B with official Harmony format

### 🎩 Multi-Agent Discussion Modes

AIfred supports various discussion modes with Sokrates (critic) and Salomo (judge):

| Mode | Flow | Who decides? |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Standard** | Any agent answers (selectable via toggle) | — |
| **Critical Review** | AIfred → Sokrates (+ Pro/Contra) → STOP | User |
| **Auto-Consensus** | AIfred → Sokrates → Salomo (X rounds) | Salomo |
| **Tribunal** | AIfred ↔ Sokrates (X rounds) → Salomo | Salomo (Verdict) |
| **Symposion** | 2+ freely selected agents discuss (X rounds), reflection layer added from round 2 onwards | No judge — multiperspective |

**Symposion-Reflection** (from round 2): Each agent is asked, in addition
to its normal contribution, "Which aspects of the original question are
still unanswered? Which perspective has been overlooked? Which assumption
has gone unchallenged?". This produces depth without forcing
confrontation — agents address gaps rather than just stating their own
view a second time. Implemented as an additive prompt layer
(`prompts/{de,en}/shared/symposion_reflection.txt`), not a replacement
of the discussion prompt.

**Agents:**
- 🎩 **AIfred** - Butler & Scholar - answers questions (British butler style with subtle elegance)
- 🏛️ **Sokrates** - Critical Philosopher - questions & challenges using the Socratic method
- 👑 **Salomo** - Wise Judge - synthesizes arguments and makes final decisions
- 📷 **Vision** - Image Analyst - OCR and visual Q&A (inherits AIfred's personality)
- 🤖 **Custom Agents** - User-created agents with full prompt customization

**Customizable Personalities:**
- All agent prompts are plain text files in `prompts/de/` and `prompts/en/`
- Agent configuration in `data/agents.json` — prompt paths, toggles, roles
- Personality can be toggled on/off in UI settings (keeps identity, removes style)
- 6-layer prompt system: Identity (who) + Reasoning (how to think) + Multi-Agent (who are others) + Task (what) + Memory (long-term, incognito-aware) + Personality (how to speak)
- **Agent Editor**: Create, edit, delete agents via UI — DOM-only inputs, DE/EN prompt editing, emoji picker
- **Memory Browser**: Inspect and manage per-agent ChromaDB memory collections (session summaries, insights, etc.)
- **Multilingual**: Agents respond in the user's language (German prompts for German, English prompts for all other languages)

**Direct Agent Addressing**:
- Address any agent by name: "Sokrates, what do you think about...?" → Sokrates answers with Socratic method
- Address AIfred directly: "AIfred, explain..." → AIfred answers without Sokrates analysis
- Custom agents addressable by ID or display name (auto-detected via intent detection)
- **Active Agent Toggle**: Pill buttons to select which agent responds in Standard mode
- Supports STT transcription variants: "Alfred", "Eifred", "AI Fred"
- Works at sentence end too: "Great explanation. Sokrates." / "Well done. Alfred!"

**Intelligent Context Handling** (v2.10.2):
- Multi-Agent messages use `role: system` with `[MULTI-AGENT CONTEXT]` prefix
- Speaker labels `[SOKRATES]:` and `[AIFRED]:` preserved for LLM context
- Prevents LLM from confusing agent exchanges with its own responses
- All prompts automatically receive current date/time for temporal queries

**Perspective System** (v2.10.3):
- Each agent sees the conversation from their own perspective
- Sokrates sees AIfred's answers as `[AIFRED]:` (user role), his own as `assistant`
- AIfred sees Sokrates' critiques as `[SOKRATES]:` (user role), his own as `assistant`
- Prevents identity confusion between agents during multi-round debates

One source, three views - depending on who is speaking.
Own messages = assistant (no label), others = user (with label).
```

**Structured Critic Prompts** (v2.10.3):
- Round number placeholder `{round_num}` - Sokrates knows which round it is
- Maximum 1-2 critique points per round
- Sokrates only critiques - never decides consensus (that's Salomo's job)

**Temperature Control** (v2.10.4):
- Auto mode: Intent-Detection determines base temperature (FACTUAL=0.2, MIXED=0.5, CREATIVE=1.1)
- Manual mode: Per-agent temperature in the sampling table
- Configurable Sokrates offset in Auto mode (default +0.2, capped at 1.0)
- All temperature settings in "LLM Parameters (Advanced)" collapsible

**Sampling Parameter Persistence:**
- **Temperature**: Persisted in `settings.json` (per-agent, survives restart)
- **Top-K, Top-P, Min-P, Repeat-Penalty**: NOT persisted — reset to model-specific defaults from llama-swap YAML config on every restart
- **Model change**: Resets ALL sampling parameters (including temperature) to YAML defaults
- **Reset button (↺)**: Resets ALL sampling parameters (including temperature) to YAML defaults

**Trialog Workflow (Auto-Consensus with Salomo):**

### 🔧 Technical Highlights
- **Reflex Framework**: React frontend generated from Python
- **WebSocket Streaming**: Real-time updates without polling
- **Adaptive Temperature**: AI selects temperature based on question type
- **Token Management**: Dynamic context window calculation
- **VRAM-Aware Context**: Automatic context sizing based on available GPU memory
- **Debug Console**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **ChromaDB Server Mode**: Thread-safe vector DB via Docker (0.0 distance for exact matches)
- **GPU Detection**: Automatic detection and warnings for incompatible backend-GPU combinations
- **Context Calibration**: Intelligent per-model calibration for Ollama and llama.cpp
  - **Ollama**: Binary search with automatic VRAM/Hybrid mode detection (512 token precision)
    - Hybrid mode for CPU+GPU offload (MoE vs Dense detection, 3 GB RAM reserve)
    - Auto-Hybrid threshold: VRAM-only < 16k tokens → switch to Hybrid
  - **llama.cpp** (3-phase calibration for multi-GPU setups):
    - **Phase 1** (GPU-only): Binary search on `-c` with `ngl=99`, stops llama-swap, tests on temp port
      - KV fallback chain: f16 → q8_0 (if < native context) → q4_0 (last resort, only if q8_0 < 32K)
      - Small model shortcut: models with `native_context ≤ 8192` are tested directly (no binary search)
      - flash-attn auto-detection: startup failure → automatic retry without `--flash-attn`, updates llama-swap YAML on success
    - **Phase 2** (Speed variant): Min-GPU strategy — calculates minimum GPUs needed for model weights, fewer GPU boundaries = less transfer overhead = faster inference (tradeoff: reduced max context). Own KV chain (f16 → q8_0), independent from Phase 1. Creates a separate `model-speed` entry in llama-swap YAML with its own KV quant
    - **Phase 3** (Hybrid fallback): If Phase 1 < 32K → NGL reduction to free VRAM for KV-cache. Inherits KV quantization from Phase 1
    - Startup errors (unknown architecture, wrong CUDA version) are logged and never written as false calibration data
  - Results cached in unified `data/model_vram_cache.json`
- **llama-swap Autoscan**: Automatic model discovery on service start (`scripts/llama-swap-autoscan.py`) — **zero manual YAML editing required**
  - Scans Ollama manifests → creates descriptive symlinks in `~/models/` (e.g., `sha256-6335adf...` → `Qwen3-14B-Q8_0.gguf`)
  - Scans HuggingFace cache (`~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`) → creates symlinks for downloaded GGUFs
  - VL models (with matching `mmproj-*.gguf`) automatically get `--mmproj` argument
  - **Compatibility test**: each new model is briefly started with llama-server — unsupported architectures (e.g. `deepseekocr`) are detected and excluded before being added to the config
  - **Skip list** (`~/.config/llama-swap/autoscan-skip.json`): incompatible models are remembered, no re-test on every restart. Delete entry to re-test after a llama.cpp update
  - Detects new GGUFs and adds llama-swap config entries with optimal defaults (`-ngl 99`, `--flash-attn on`, `-ctk q8_0`, etc.)
  - Automatically maintains `groups.main.members` in the YAML — all models share VRAM exclusivity without manual editing
  - Creates preliminary VRAM cache entries (calibration via UI adds `vram_used_mb` measured while the model is loaded)
  - Creates `config.yaml` from scratch if not present — no manual bootstrap required
  - Runs as `ExecStartPre` in systemd service → `ollama pull model` or `hf download` is all it takes to add a model
- **Ctx/Speed Switch**: Per-agent toggle between two pre-calibrated variants (Ctx = max context, ⚡ Speed = 32K + aggressive GPU split)
- **RoPE 2x Extended Context**: Optional extended calibration up to 2x native context limit
- **Parallel Web Search**: 2-3 optimized queries distributed in parallel across APIs (Tavily, Brave, SearXNG), automatic URL deduplication, optional self-hosted SearXNG
- **Parallel Scraping**: ThreadPoolExecutor scrapes 3-7 URLs simultaneously, first successful results are used
- **Failed Sources Display**: Shows unavailable URLs with error reasons (Cloudflare, 404, Timeout)
- **PDF Support**: Direct extraction from PDF documents (AWMF guidelines, PubMed PDFs) via PyMuPDF with browser-like User-Agent

### 🔊 Voice Interface (TTS Engines)

AIfred supports 8 TTS engines with different trade-offs between quality, latency, and resource usage. Each engine was chosen for a specific use case after extensive experimentation. The preferred engine is the **local Qwen3-TTS container**.

| Engine | Type | Streaming | Quality | Latency* | Resources |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Qwen3-TTS 1.7B** | Local Docker | Sentence-level | High (voice cloning, 10 languages incl. native DE) | ~8.5s | ~5-7 GB VRAM |
| **XTTS v2** | Local Docker | Sentence-level | High (voice cloning) | ~2.8s | ~2 GB VRAM |
| **Fish-Speech S2 Pro** | Local Docker | Sentence-level | High (voice cloning, 80+ languages) | ~11s | ~20-24 GB VRAM |
| **MOSS-TTS 1.7B** | Local Docker | None (batch after bubble) | Excellent (best open-source) | ~14.8s | ~11.5 GB VRAM |
| **DashScope Qwen3-TTS** | Cloud API | Sentence-level | High (voice cloning) | ~1-2s/sentence | API key only |
| **Piper TTS** | Local | Sentence-level | Medium | <100ms | CPU only |
| **eSpeak** | Local | Sentence-level | Low (robotic) | <50ms | CPU only |
| **Edge TTS** | Cloud | Sentence-level | Good | ~200ms | Internet only |

\* Local cloning engines measured head-to-head on the same bilingual test paragraph (V100, fp16) — full comparison in [TTS Model Comparison](docs/en/models/tts-comparison.md).

**Why multiple engines?**

The search for the perfect TTS experience led through several iterations:

- **Edge TTS** was the first engine -- free, fast, decent quality, but limited voices and no voice cloning.
- **XTTS v2** added high-quality voice cloning with multilingual support. Sentence-level streaming works well: while the LLM generates the next sentence, XTTS synthesizes the current one. However, it requires a Docker container and ~2 GB VRAM.
- **MOSS-TTS 1.7B** delivers the best speech quality of all open-source models (SIM 73-79%), but at a cost: ~15-22 seconds per sentence (depending on GPU) makes it unsuitable for streaming. Audio is generated as a batch after the complete response, which is acceptable for short answers but frustrating for longer ones.
- **Qwen3-TTS 1.7B** (local Docker container) is the current default engine — the best quality/speed compromise in the head-to-head test. Voice cloning from ~3 seconds of reference audio, 10 languages with native German support, Apache 2.0 license. Reference voices (`docker/tts/voices/`) are pre-warmed at container start; speed/pitch are post-processed centrally via ffmpeg.
- **Fish-Speech S2 Pro** (5B Dual-AR, 80+ languages) delivers high cloning quality, but is heavy: ~20-24 GB VRAM under load (calibration reserves 26 GB). Its research/non-commercial license also keeps it out of the channel dropdowns (FreeEcho.2 etc.) — browser use only.
- **DashScope Qwen3-TTS** is the cloud counterpart to the local Qwen3-TTS container — voice cloning via Alibaba Cloud's API, no local VRAM needed. By default it uses sentence-level streaming (same as XTTS) for better intonation. A realtime WebSocket mode (word-level chunks, ~200ms first audio) is also implemented but disabled by default -- it trades slightly worse prosody for faster first-audio. To re-enable it, uncomment the WebSocket block in `state.py:_init_streaming_tts()` (see code comment there).
- **Piper TTS** and **eSpeak** serve as lightweight offline alternatives that work without Docker, GPU, or internet connection.

All local engines follow the same container conventions (REST API with `/tts` + `/health`, shared voice directory, idle tracking) — a new engine is a subclass in `aifred/lib/tts_engines/` plus one registry entry, no scattered if/else cascades. See [TTS Container Conventions](docs/de/architecture/tts-container-conventions.md) (German).

**Playback Architecture:**
- Visible HTML5 `<audio>` widget with blob-URL prefetching (next 2 chunks pre-fetched into memory)
- `preservesPitch: true` for speed adjustments without chipmunk effect
- Per-agent voice/pitch/speed settings — every agent, built-in or custom, can have its own voice
- SSE-based audio streaming from backend to browser (persistent connection, 15s keepalive)

### ☁️ Cloud API Support

AIfred supports cloud LLM providers via OpenAI-compatible APIs:

| Provider | Models | API Key Variable |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Qwen (DashScope)** | qwen-plus, qwen-turbo, qwen-max | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` |
| **DeepSeek** | deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| **Claude (Anthropic)** | claude-3.5-sonnet, claude-3-opus | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| **Kimi (Moonshot)** | moonshot-v1-8k, moonshot-v1-32k | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` |

**Features:**
- Dynamic model fetching (models loaded from provider's `/models` endpoint)
- Token usage tracking (prompt + completion tokens displayed in debug console)
- Per-provider model memory (each provider remembers its last used model)
- Vision model filtering (excludes `-vl` variants from main LLM dropdown)
- Streaming support with real-time output

**Note:** Cloud APIs don't require local GPU resources - ideal for:
- Testing larger models without hardware investment
- Mobile/laptop usage without dedicated GPU
- Comparing cloud vs local model quality

### ⚠️ Model Recommendations
- **Automatik-LLM** (Intent Detection, Query Optimization, Addressee Detection): Medium instruct models recommended
  - **Recommended**: `qwen3:14b` (Q4 or Q8 quantization)
  - Better semantic understanding for complex addressee detection ("What does Alfred think about Salomo's answer?")
  - Small 4B models may struggle with nuanced sentence semantics
  - Thinking mode is automatically disabled for Automatik tasks (fast decisions)
  - **"(same as AIfred-LLM)"** option available - uses the same model as AIfred without extra VRAM
- **Main LLM**: Use larger models (14B+, ideally 30B+) for better context understanding and prompt following
  - Both Instruct and Thinking models work well
  - Enable "Thinking Mode" for chain-of-thought reasoning on complex tasks
  - **Language Note**: Small models (4B-14B) may respond in English when RAG context contains predominantly English web content, even with German prompts. Models 30B+ reliably follow language instructions regardless of context language.

## 🔄 Research Mode Workflows

The research mode (per session, UI toggle) decides how an agent gets information from the web. Every research runs fresh — there is deliberately no result cache: how similar two questions are says nothing about whether an earlier answer still holds (weather, prices, news). Within a conversation the results stay in the history anyway.

| Mode | What happens | Tools for the agent |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Own Knowledge** (`none`) | Direct answer from the model | ❌ none |
| **Automatik** (`automatik`, default) | The agent decides via tool calls whether and what to search | ✅ incl. `web_search`, `web_fetch` |
| **Quick Web Search** (`quick`) | Research pipeline runs before the answer, top 3 URLs | ✅ still available |
| **Deep Web Search** (`deep`) | Research pipeline runs before the answer, top 7 URLs | ✅ still available |

---

### 🔄 Pre-Processing (all modes)

**Shared first step** for all research modes:

```
Intent + Addressee Detection
├─ LLM Call (Automatik-LLM) - one combined call
├─ Prompt: automatik/intent_detection
├─ Response: "INTENT|ADDRESSEE|LANGUAGE|MODE_SWITCH|IS_PURE_COMMAND"
│  └─ e.g. "FACTUAL||DE||FALSE" or "MIXED|sokrates|DE||FALSE"
├─ Temperature usage:
│  ├─ Auto-Mode: FACTUAL=0.2, MIXED=0.5, CREATIVE=1.0
│  └─ Manual-Mode: Intent ignored, manual value used
├─ Addressee: Direct agent addressing (sokrates/aifred/salomo/...)
└─ Mode switch: spoken/typed config changes ("start a tribunal")
```

When an agent is directly addressed, that agent is activated immediately, regardless of the selected research mode or temperature setting.

Before every LLM call the history compression check runs (70% of the smallest context window, see [History Compression System](#history-compression-system)).

---

### 🔎 Research Pipeline

One pipeline (`execute_research()` in `aifred/lib/research_tools.py`) serves both the forced path (quick/deep) and the `web_search` tool:

```
1. Query Generation (quick/deep only)
   ├─ Automatik-LLM, prompt: automatik/query_generation (+ Vision JSON if present)
   ├─ 3 queries: #1 always English, #2-3 in the language of the question
   └─ Tool path: skipped — the agent passes 1-3 queries in its web_search call

2. Multi-API Web Search
   ├─ Round-robin: query 1 → SearXNG (self-hosted), 2 → Tavily, 3 → Brave
   │  (API keys optional), automatic fallback if an API fails;
   │  a single query goes to all APIs in parallel
   ├─ URL deduplication across APIs
   └─ Non-scrapable domains filtered (data/non_scrapable_domains.txt:
      video platforms, social media)

3. URL Ranking
   ├─ Automatik-LLM, prompt: automatik/url_ranking (numeric output)
   ├─ Sees the conversation history (follow-up questions rank correctly)
   └─ Top 3 (quick) or top 7 (deep and every web_search tool call)

4. Parallel Scraping
   ├─ trafilatura first; Playwright (headless Chromium) if it returns
   │  fewer than 800 words (PLAYWRIGHT_FALLBACK_THRESHOLD)
   ├─ No Playwright retry for failed downloads (404, timeout, bot protection)
   ├─ Failed sources are listed with their error reason
   └─ Main model preloads in parallel (not for vLLM — it stays resident)

5. Context Building
   ├─ build_context(): scraped text, token-aware
   └─ Sources collapsible for the UI (used + failed sources)
```

**How the results reach the agent:**
- **Quick/Deep:** the context is inserted as its own message directly before the user question, fenced as untrusted data (prompt-injection guard). Keeping it out of the system prompt also keeps the prompt prefix stable for the KV cache.
- **Automatik:** the `web_search` result (fenced the same way) goes back into the tool loop; the agent may search again or read a single page with `web_fetch`.
- **Message Hub** (Discord, e-mail, ...): `hub_web_search()` — same building blocks without browser state.

### 📝 Automatik-LLM Prompts Reference

The Automatik-LLM uses dedicated prompts in `prompts/{de,en}/automatik/`:

| Prompt | Language | When Called | Purpose |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `intent_detection.txt` | EN only | Pre-processing | Intent (FACTUAL/MIXED/CREATIVE), addressee, language, mode switch |
| `query_generation.txt` | DE + EN | Quick/Deep, phase 1 | Generate 3 search queries |
| `url_ranking.txt` | EN only | Pipeline phase 3 | Rank URLs by relevance (output: numeric indices) |

**Language Rules:**
- **EN only**: Output is structured/numeric (parseable), language doesn't affect result
- **DE + EN**: Output depends on user's language or requires semantic understanding in that language

**Prompt Directory Structure:**
```
prompts/
├── de/
│   └── automatik/
│       └── query_generation.txt       # German queries for German users
└── en/

## 🌐 REST API (Browser Remote Control)

AIfred provides a complete REST API for programmatic control - enabling remote operation via Cloud, automation systems, and third-party integrations.

### Architecture: Browser as Execution Engine

The API acts as a **Browser Remote Control** - it doesn't run LLM inference itself, but injects messages into the browser session which then executes the full pipeline:

```
API Request ──→ set_pending_message() ──→ Browser polls (1s)
                                              │
                                              ↓
                                    send_message() pipeline
                                              │
                                              ↓
                              Intent Detection, Multi-Agent, Research...
                                              │
                                              ↓
                              Response visible in Browser + API
```

**Benefits:**
- **One code path**: API uses exactly the same code as manual browser input
- **All features work**: Multi-Agent, Research Mode, Vision, History Compression
- **Live feedback**: User sees streaming output in browser while API waits
- **Less code**: No duplicate LLM logic in API layer

### Per-Session Config SSOT

Agent selection, discussion mode, and research mode are **persisted per session**, not globally. Every chat session has its own `config` block stored in its session file:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "config": {
      "active_agent": "aifred",
      "multi_agent_mode": "standard",
      "symposion_agents": [],
      "research_mode": "automatik"
    }
  }
}
```

**Clean default** on new session: every new chat starts with `aifred + standard + automatik` — never inheriting from the previous session.

**Multi-tab / cross-channel sync** via session file mtime-watching: whenever any writer (browser tab, API, email channel, voice puck) modifies the session file, all other tabs that have this session open detect the change within 1 second and reload — without polling, without events, without race conditions. This replaces the legacy `update_flag` mechanism entirely.

### Voice Mode Switching

The Intent Detection LLM call runs before every message and now also detects mode-switch requests in **any language**. Say (or type) something like:
- "Start tribunal and discuss climate change" — switches to Tribunal mode AND answers
- "Schalt auf Tiefrecherche" — switches to deep research
- "Démarre le tribunal" — works in French
- "Nur Sokrates soll antworten" — locks the agent to Sokrates

The detector extracts the **remaining query** so the user can combine a mode-switch with a real question in one sentence. Pure switches (just the command) respond with a confirmation; combined requests apply the switch and continue with the remaining query in the new mode.

### Key Features

- **Full Remote Control**: Control all AIfred settings from anywhere
- **Live Browser Sync**: API changes automatically appear in the browser UI via session mtime-watching
- **Message Injection**: Queue messages that browser processes with full pipeline
- **Session Management**: Access and manage multiple browser sessions
- **Per-session Config**: Agent, discussion mode, and research mode stored per session (not global)
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Interactive Swagger UI at `/docs`

### API Endpoints

The API enables **pure remote control** - messages are injected into browser sessions, the browser performs the full processing (Intent Detection, Multi-Agent, Research, etc.). The user sees everything live in the browser.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check with backend status |
| `/api/settings` | GET | Retrieve global settings |
| `/api/settings` | PATCH | Update global settings (backend, models, TTS, …) |
| `/api/session/config` | POST | Update per-session config (agent, mode, research mode) |
| `/api/models` | GET | List available models |
| `/api/chat/inject` | POST | Inject message into browser session |
| `/api/chat/status` | GET | Check if inference is running (is_generating, message_count) |
| `/api/chat/history` | GET | Get chat history |
| `/api/chat/clear` | POST | Clear chat history |
| `/api/sessions` | GET | List all browser sessions |
| `/api/system/restart-ollama` | POST | Restart Ollama |
| `/api/system/restart-aifred` | POST | Restart AIfred |
| `/api/calibrate` | POST | Start context calibration |

**Global vs per-session:** `/api/settings` covers truly global settings (backend, models, TTS voices, language, sampling). Anything that belongs to a specific conversation — agent, multi-agent mode, research mode, symposion participants — goes through `/api/session/config` and is stored in the session file as SSOT.

### Browser Synchronization

When you change settings or inject messages via API, the browser UI updates automatically:

- **Chat Sync**: Injected messages trigger full inference in browser within 2 seconds
- **Session Config Sync**: Mode / agent / research mode changes reach all open tabs within ~1 second via session file mtime-watching
- **Global Settings Sync**: Model changes, TTS voices, temperature etc. update live in the UI
- **Status Polling**: Use `/api/chat/status` to wait for inference completion

This enables true remote control - change AIfred's configuration from another device and see the changes reflected immediately in any connected browser.

### Example Usage

```bash
# Get current global settings
curl http://localhost:8002/api/settings

# Change model (global setting)
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8002/api/settings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"aifred_model": "qwen3:14b"}'

# Switch a session to Tribunal mode (per-session config)
# All tabs viewing this session detect the change automatically.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/session/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id": "abc123...", "multi_agent_mode": "tribunal"}'

# Switch agent + research mode in one call
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/session/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id": "abc123...", "active_agent": "sokrates", "research_mode": "deep"}'

# Inject a message (browser runs full pipeline)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/chat/inject \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is Python?", "device_id": "abc123..."}'

# Poll until inference is complete
curl "http://localhost:8002/api/chat/status?device_id=abc123..."
# Returns: {"is_generating": false, "message_count": 5}

# Get the response
curl "http://localhost:8002/api/chat/history?device_id=abc123..."

# List all browser sessions (to get device_id)
curl http://localhost:8002/api/sessions
```

### Use Cases

- **Cloud Control**: Operate AIfred from anywhere via HTTPS/API
- **Home Automation**: Integration with Home Assistant, Node-RED, etc.
- **Voice Assistants**: Alexa/Google Home can send AIfred queries
- **Batch Processing**: Automated queries via scripts
- **Mobile Apps**: Custom apps can use the API
- **Remote Maintenance**: Test and monitor AIfred on headless systems

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- **LLM Backend** (choose one):
  - **llama.cpp** via llama-swap (GGUF models) - best performance, full GPU control ([setup guide](docs/en/guides/llamacpp-setup.md))
  - **Ollama** (easy, GGUF models) - recommended for getting started
  - **vLLM** (fast, AWQ models) - best performance for AWQ (requires Compute Capability 7.5+)
  - **TabbyAPI** (ExLlamaV2/V3, EXL2 models) - experimental

> **Zero-Config Model Management (llama.cpp backend):** After the initial setup, adding models requires no manual configuration. Just run `ollama pull model` or `hf download ...`, then restart llama-swap — the autoscan configures everything automatically (YAML entries, groups, VRAM cache). See [docs/en/guides/deployment.md](docs/en/guides/deployment.md) for the full setup guide.
- 8GB+ RAM (12GB+ recommended for larger models)
- Docker (for ChromaDB: documents and agent memory)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU recommended (see [GPU Compatibility Detection](#gpu-compatibility-detection))

### Setup

**Recommended: one-shot installer** — handles system dependencies, the
Python venv, all requirements, the Playwright browser, the Reflex
routing patch, optional systemd services, the `.env` file, the
`bge-m3` embedding pull and a first whitelist user in one go:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIfred-Intelligence.git
cd AIfred-Intelligence
./scripts/install-all.sh
```

The installer is interactive (asks whether to install systemd services
and whether to create a whitelist user). It detects `apt`, `dnf`,
`pacman` and `brew` and installs: `python3-venv`, `python3-pip`,
`poppler-utils`, `ffmpeg`, `bubblewrap`, `docker`, `docker-compose-plugin`.
Ollama itself is **not** auto-installed (the official installer is
`curl | sh` — install it manually for safety).

---

The steps below describe the same process **manually**, in case you
prefer to do it yourself or need to debug:

1. **Clone repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIfred-Intelligence.git
cd AIfred-Intelligence
```

2. **Create virtual environment**:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install Playwright browser (for JS-heavy pages).
# Use --with-deps to also install system libraries (libnss3 etc.) — requires sudo.
# Plain `playwright install chromium` works too but the headless browser may
# fail to start later if libnss3/libxkbcommon0/etc. are missing.
sudo $(which playwright) install --with-deps chromium     # recommended on fresh servers
# playwright install chromium                              # binary-only (no system libs)
# Apply the Reflex frontend_path routing patch
python scripts/patch-reflex.py
```

**Main Dependencies** (see `requirements.txt`):
| Category | Packages |
|----------|----------|
| Framework | reflex, fastapi, pydantic |
| LLM Backends | httpx, openai, pynvml, psutil |
| Web Research | trafilatura, playwright, requests, pymupdf |
| Documents / Memory | chromadb, ollama, numpy |
| Audio (STT/TTS) | TTS containers under `docker/tts/` (Qwen3-TTS, XTTS v2, Fish-Speech, MOSS-TTS), edge-tts, piper, openai-whisper (Docker) |

4. **Environment variables** (.env):
```env
# API Keys for web research
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Ollama configuration
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Cloud LLM API Keys (optional - only needed if using cloud backends)
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_key_here      # Qwen (DashScope) - https://dashscope.console.aliyun.com/
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here       # DeepSeek - https://platform.deepseek.com/
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here      # Claude (Anthropic) - https://console.anthropic.com/
MOONSHOT_API_KEY=your_key_here       # Kimi (Moonshot) - https://platform.moonshot.cn/
```

5. **Install LLM Models**:

**Option A: Ollama (GGUF) — Easiest, Recommended**

```bash
# Embedding model (required for Documents / Memory)
ollama pull bge-m3

# Recommended core models — pick what fits your VRAM:
ollama pull qwen3:30b-instruct   # 18 GB, Main-LLM, 256K context
ollama pull qwen3:8b             # 5.2 GB, Automatik, optional thinking
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b           # 1.9 GB, Ultra-fast Automatik
```

The recommended models above are picked up automatically by AIfred's
model discovery on startup — no YAML editing needed.

**Option B: llama.cpp (GGUF) via llama-swap — Best GPU Control**

Download GGUFs into `~/models/<name>/` and restart llama-swap; the
autoscan adds YAML entries automatically. See [docs/en/guides/llamacpp-setup.md](docs/en/guides/llamacpp-setup.md).

```bash
hf download <repo> --local-dir ~/models/<name>
llama-swap-restart    # symlinked by install-services.sh
```

**Option C: vLLM (AWQ) — Best Throughput**

```bash
pip install vllm

# Recommended models:
# - Qwen3-8B-AWQ (~5GB, 40K→128K with YaRN)
# - Qwen3-14B-AWQ (~8GB, 32K→128K with YaRN)
# - Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-AWQ (~8GB, 128K native)

# Start vLLM server with YaRN (64K context)
./venv/bin/vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-14B-AWQ \
  --quantization awq_marlin \
  --port 8001 \
  --rope-scaling '{"rope_type":"yarn","factor":2.0,"original_max_position_embeddings":32768}' \
  --max-model-len 65536 \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.85
```

**Option D: TabbyAPI (EXL2) — Experimental**
```bash
# Not yet fully implemented
# See: https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI
```

6. **Pull the Embedding Model**:

The vector database uses **BGE-M3** (multilingual, 8192 token context,
1024-dim) via Ollama. Pull it once:
```bash
ollama pull bge-m3
```
The model is shared by the ChromaDB collections (indexed documents,
agent memory). At runtime AIfred picks
**GPU mode** for bulk indexing (warm for ~1 min between chunks) and
**CPU mode** for single-shot queries (warm for ~30 min, no VRAM
contention with the active LLM).

7. **Start ChromaDB** (Docker):

**Prerequisites:** Docker Compose v2 recommended
```bash
# Install Docker Compose v2 (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
docker compose version  # should show v2.x.x
```

**Start ChromaDB:**
```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d chromadb
cd ..

# Verify it's healthy
docker ps | grep chroma
# Should show: (healthy) in status

# Test API v2
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/heartbeat
```

**Optional: Also start SearXNG** (local search engine):
```bash
cd docker
docker compose --profile full up -d
cd ..
```

**Reset ChromaDB** (if needed — deletes indexed documents and agent memories):

*Option 1: Complete reset (deletes all data)*
```bash
cd docker
docker compose stop chromadb
sudo rm -rf ../data/chromadb/   # files are created by the container (root)
docker compose up -d chromadb
cd ..
```

*Option 2: Delete a single collection (while container is running)*
```bash
./venv/bin/python -c "
import chromadb
from chromadb.config import Settings

client = chromadb.HttpClient(
    host='localhost',
    port=8000,
    settings=Settings(anonymized_telemetry=False)
)

try:
    client.delete_collection('aifred_documents')  # or 'agent_memory_<agent_id>'
    print('✅ Collection deleted')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'⚠️ Error: {e}')
"
```

Single entries or a whole collection can also be deleted in the Settings modal (Database and Memory tabs).

8. **Start Qwen3-TTS Voice Cloning** (Recommended, Docker):

The local Qwen3-TTS container (1.7B base model) is the preferred TTS engine — best quality/speed compromise, voice cloning from ~3 seconds of reference audio, 10 languages with native German support, Apache 2.0.

```bash
cd docker/tts/qwen3-tts
docker compose up -d
```

**Features:**
- Shared voice directory `docker/tts/voices/<Name>/<Name>.wav` (+ optional transcript) — reference voices are pre-warmed at container start
- Sentence-level streaming during LLM generation, speed/pitch via central ffmpeg post-processing
- ~5-7 GB VRAM on the TTS side-channel GPU (calibration reserves 7.5 GB)
- REST API on port 5052 (`/tts`, `/health`, `/voices`) — same conventions as all other TTS containers

9. **Start XTTS Voice Cloning** (Optional, Docker):

XTTS v2 provides high-quality voice cloning with multilingual support and smart GPU/CPU selection.

```bash
cd docker/tts/xtts
docker compose up -d
```

First start takes ~2-3 minutes (model download ~1.5GB). After that, XTTS is available as TTS engine in the UI settings.

**Features:**
- 58 built-in voices + custom voice cloning (6-10s reference audio)
- Automatic GPU/CPU selection based on available VRAM
- **Manual CPU-Mode Toggle**: Save GPU VRAM for larger LLM context window (slower TTS)
- Multilingual support (16 languages) with automatic code-switching (DE/EN mixed)
- Per-agent voices with individual pitch and speed settings
- **Multi-Agent TTS Queue**: Sequential playback of all participating agents' responses in speaking order
- Async TTS generation (doesn't block next LLM inference)
- **VRAM Management**: In GPU mode, ~2 GB VRAM is reserved and deducted from LLM context window

See [docker/tts/xtts/README.md](docker/tts/xtts/README.md) for full documentation.

10. **Start MOSS-TTS Voice Cloning** (Optional, Docker):

MOSS-TTS (MossTTSLocal 1.7B) provides state-of-the-art zero-shot voice cloning across 20 languages with excellent speech quality.

```bash
cd docker/tts/moss-tts
docker compose up -d
```

First start takes ~5-10 minutes (model download ~3-5 GB). After that, MOSS-TTS is available as TTS engine in the UI settings.

**Features:**
- Zero-shot voice cloning (reference audio, no transcription needed)
- 20 languages including German and English
- Excellent speech quality (EN SIM 73.42%, ZH SIM 78.82% - best open-source)

**Limitations:**
- **High VRAM usage**: ~11.5 GB in BF16 (vs. 2 GB for XTTS)
- **Not suitable for streaming**: ~18-22s per sentence (vs. ~1-2s for XTTS)
- **VRAM Management**: In GPU mode, ~11.5 GB VRAM is reserved and deducted from LLM context window
- Recommended for high-quality offline audio generation, not for real-time streaming

11. **Start Fish-Speech S2 Pro** (Optional, Docker):

Fish Audio S2 Pro (5B Dual-AR, 80+ languages) provides high-quality voice cloning via server-side reference IDs.

```bash
cd docker/tts/fish-speech
docker compose up -d
```

First start takes a while (~8 GB weights pulled from HuggingFace). Note: heavy VRAM footprint (~20-24 GB under load, calibration reserves 26 GB) and a research/non-commercial license — therefore not offered to external channels (FreeEcho.2 etc.), browser use only.

12. **Start application**:
```bash
reflex run
```

Reflex starts **two** processes: the frontend (Node, port `3002`) and the
backend (Granian/FastAPI, port `8002`). For the full UI — including camera
thumbnails, the Vigilantia live view, Casus previews and audio — put a reverse
proxy in front of both and open the app through it (no port in the URL).
Opening `http://localhost:3002/aifred/` directly loads the pages but 404s every
`/api/*` and `/_upload/*` request, so images and audio stay blank. See
**[Access the web UI](docs/en/guides/deployment.md#access-the-web-ui)** for a
generic nginx routing example.

## ⚙️ Backend Switching & Settings

### Multi-Backend Support

AIfred supports different LLM backends that can be switched dynamically in the UI:

- **llama.cpp** (via llama-swap): GGUF models, best raw performance (+43% generation, +30% prompt processing vs Ollama), full GPU control, multi-GPU support. Uses a 3-tier architecture: **llama-swap** (Go proxy, model management) → **llama-server** (inference) → **llama.cpp** (library). Automatic VRAM calibration via 3-phase Binary Search: GPU-only context sizing → Speed variant with optimized tensor-split for multi-GPU throughput → Hybrid NGL fallback for oversized models. See [setup guide](docs/en/guides/llamacpp-setup.md).
- **Ollama**: GGUF models (Q4/Q8), easiest installation, automatic model management, good performance after v2.32.0 optimizations
- **vLLM**: AWQ models (4-bit), best performance with AWQ Marlin kernel
- **TabbyAPI**: EXL2 models (ExLlamaV2/V3) - experimental, basic support only

### GPU Compatibility Detection

AIfred automatically detects your GPU at startup and warns about incompatible backend configurations:

- **Tesla P40 / GTX 10 Series** (Pascal): Use llama.cpp or Ollama (GGUF) - vLLM/AWQ not supported
- **RTX 20+ Series** (Turing/Ampere/Ada): llama.cpp (GGUF) or vLLM (AWQ) recommended for best performance

### Settings Persistence

Settings are saved in `data/settings.json`:

**Per-Backend Model Storage:**
- Each backend remembers its last used models
- When switching backends, the correct models are automatically restored
- On first start, defaults from `aifred/lib/config.py` are used

**Sampling Parameter Persistence:**

| Parameter | Persisted? | On Restart | On Model Change |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Temperature | Yes (settings.json) | Kept | Reset to YAML |
| Top-K, Top-P, Min-P, Repeat-Penalty | No | Reset to YAML | Reset to YAML |

Source of truth for sampling defaults: `--temp`, `--top-k`, `--top-p`, `--min-p`, `--repeat-penalty` flags in the llama-swap YAML config (`~/.config/llama-swap/config.yaml`).

**Example Settings Structure:**
`backend_models` is the **single source of truth** for every model field
(main, automatik, vision, Sokrates, Salomo) — the browser UI, the REST API
(`PATCH /api/settings`) and the Message Hub all read and write the same
per-backend structure, so a model change from any entry point reaches all
channels:
```json
{
  "backend_type": "vllm",
  "enable_thinking": true,
  "backend_models": {
    "ollama": {
      "aifred_model": "qwen3:8b",
      "automatik_model": "qwen2.5:3b",
      "vision_model": "",
      "sokrates_model": "",
      "salomo_model": ""
    },
    "vllm": {
      "aifred_model": "Qwen/Qwen3-8B-AWQ",
      "automatik_model": "Qwen/Qwen3-4B-AWQ"
    }
  }
}
```

### Reasoning Mode (Chain-of-Thought)

AIfred supports per-agent reasoning configuration for enhanced answer quality.

**Per-Agent Reasoning Toggles** (v2.23.0):

Each agent (AIfred, Sokrates, Salomo) has its own reasoning toggle in the LLM settings. These toggles control **both** mechanisms:

1. **Reasoning Prompt**: Chain-of-Thought instructions in the system prompt (works for ALL models)
2. **enable_thinking Flag**: Technical flag for thinking-capable models (Qwen3, QwQ, NemoTron)

| Toggle | Reasoning Prompt | enable_thinking | Effect |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **ON** | ✅ Injected | ✅ True | Full CoT with `<think>` blocks (thinking models) |
| **ON** | ✅ Injected | ✅ True | CoT instructions followed (instruct models, no `<think>`) |
| **OFF** | ❌ Not injected | ❌ False | Direct answers, no reasoning |

**Design Rationale:**
- Instruct models (without native `<think>` tags) benefit from CoT prompt instructions
- Thinking models receive both: CoT prompt + technical flag for `<think>` block generation
- This unified approach provides consistent behavior regardless of model type

**Additional Features:**
- **Formatting**: Reasoning process displayed as collapsible accordion with model name and inference time
- **Temperature**: Independent from reasoning - uses Intent Detection (auto) or manual value in sampling table
- **Automatik-LLM**: Reasoning always DISABLED for Automatik decisions (8x faster)

### History Compression System

At 70% context utilization, older conversations are automatically compressed using **PRE-MESSAGE checks** (v2.12.0):

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `HISTORY_COMPRESSION_TRIGGER` | 0.7 (70%) | Compression triggers at this context utilization |
| `HISTORY_COMPRESSION_TARGET` | 0.3 (30%) | Target after compression (room for ~2 roundtrips) |
| `HISTORY_SUMMARY_RATIO` | 0.25 (4:1) | Summary = 25% of content being compressed |
| `HISTORY_SUMMARY_MIN_TOKENS` | 500 | Minimum for meaningful summaries |
| `HISTORY_SUMMARY_TOLERANCE` | 0.5 (50%) | Allowed overshoot, above this gets truncated |
| `HISTORY_SUMMARY_MAX_RATIO` | 0.2 (20%) | Max context percentage for summaries (NEW) |

**Algorithm (PRE-MESSAGE):**
1. **PRE-CHECK** before each LLM call (not after!)
2. **Trigger** at 70% context utilization
3. **Dynamic max_summaries** based on context size (20% budget / 500 tok)
4. **FIFO cleanup**: If too many summaries, oldest is deleted first
5. **Collect** oldest messages until remaining < 30%
6. **Compress** collected messages to summary (4:1 ratio)
7. **New History** = [Summaries] + [remaining messages]

**Dynamic Summary Limits:**
| Context | Max Summaries | Calculation |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| 4K | 1-2 | 4096 × 0.2 / 500 = 1.6 |
| 8K | 3 | 8192 × 0.2 / 500 = 3.3 |
| 32K | 10 | 32768 × 0.2 / 500 = 13 → capped at 10 |

**Token Estimation:** Ignores `<details>`, `<span>`, `<think>` tags (not sent to LLM)

**Examples by Context Size:**
| Context | Trigger | Target | Compressed | Summary |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|---------|
| 7K | 4,900 tok | 2,100 tok | ~2,800 tok | ~700 tok |
| 40K | 28,000 tok | 12,000 tok | ~16,000 tok | ~4,000 tok |
| 200K | 140,000 tok | 60,000 tok | ~80,000 tok | ~20,000 tok |

**Inline Summaries (UI, v2.14.2+):**
- Summaries appear inline where compression occurred
- Each summary as collapsible with header (number, message count)
- FIFO applies only to `llm_history` (LLM sees 1 summary)
- `chat_history` keeps ALL summaries (user sees full history)

### ChromaDB: Documents & Agent Memory

ChromaDB (Docker, data in `data/chromadb/`) holds two kinds of collections, both embedded with bge-m3 (`aifred/lib/embeddings.py`):

| Collection | Content | Access |
|------------|---------|--------|
| `aifred_documents` | Indexed documents (token-accurate chunks) | Agents search via the `search_documents` tool; managed in the Document UI and by the Workspace plugin |
| `agent_memory_<agent_id>` | Per-agent long-term memory (session summaries, insights, ...) | Relevant entries are recalled before an answer; agents store new ones via tools |

Web research results are **not** stored — every research runs fresh (see [Research Mode Workflows](#-research-mode-workflows)).

**Maintenance:** browse and delete entries in the Settings modal (Database and Memory tabs). `scripts/chromadb-vacuum.sh` returns the space freed by deletes to the OS (stops the container for a few seconds).

## 🔧 Configuration

All important parameters in `aifred/lib/config.py`:

```python
# History Compression (dynamic, percentage-based)
HISTORY_COMPRESSION_TRIGGER = 0.7    # 70% - When to compress?
HISTORY_COMPRESSION_TARGET = 0.3     # 30% - Where to compress to?
HISTORY_SUMMARY_RATIO = 0.25         # 25% = 4:1 compression
HISTORY_SUMMARY_MIN_TOKENS = 500     # Minimum for summaries
HISTORY_SUMMARY_TOLERANCE = 0.5      # 50% overshoot allowed

# Intent-based Temperature
INTENT_TEMPERATURE_FAKTISCH = 0.2    # Factual queries
INTENT_TEMPERATURE_GEMISCHT = 0.5    # Mixed queries
INTENT_TEMPERATURE_KREATIV = 1.0     # Creative queries

# Backend-specific Default Models (in BACKEND_DEFAULT_MODELS)
# Ollama: qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4_K_M (Automatik), qwen3-vl:8b (Vision)
# vLLM: cpatonn/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-AWQ-4bit, etc.
```

### HTTP Timeout Configuration

In `aifred/backends/ollama.py`:
- **HTTP Client Timeout**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Increased from 60s for large research requests with 30KB+ context
- Prevents timeout errors during first token generation

### Restart Button Behavior

The AIfred restart button restarts the systemd service:
- Executes `systemctl restart aifred-intelligence`
- Browser reloads automatically after short delay
- Debug logs cleared, sessions preserved

---

## 📦 Deployment

### Systemd Service

For production operation as a service, pre-configured service files are available in the `systemd/` directory.

#### Quick Installation

```bash
# 1. Install services (do NOT copy the unit files by hand!)
#    The unit files contain __PROJECT_DIR__/__USER__ placeholders that
#    only this script substitutes (via sed). It renders + copies the
#    units and drop-ins, runs daemon-reload, enables + starts them, and
#    creates the llama-swap-restart symlink in ~/bin. A plain `cp` would
#    leave the placeholders in place and the service would never start.
sudo ./scripts/install-services.sh

# 2. Check status
systemctl status aifred-chromadb.service
systemctl status aifred-intelligence.service

# 3. Create first user (required for login)
./aifred-admin add yourusername
# Then register in the web UI with username + password
```

See [systemd/README.md](systemd/README.md) for details, troubleshooting, and monitoring.

#### llama-swap restart helper

[`scripts/llama-swap-restart.sh`](scripts/llama-swap-restart.sh) is the standard
maintenance script you'll use after downloading a new model or editing the
llama-swap YAML config. It performs a clean restart that goes beyond a plain
`systemctl restart`:

1. Stops `llama-swap.service` and waits for inactive state
2. Kills any leftover `llama-server` processes (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL)
3. Waits for VRAM to be actually released by the GPU driver
4. **Cleans up orphan lookup-cache files** in `~/.cache/llama_lookup_*.bin` whose
   model entry no longer exists in `config.yaml`
5. Starts `llama-swap.service` and waits for the `listening` log line

`scripts/install-services.sh` automatically creates a symlink at
`~/bin/llama-swap-restart` so you can call it from anywhere. After downloading
a new GGUF model:

```bash
hf download <repo> --local-dir ~/models/<name>
llama-swap-restart  # Autoscan picks up the new model, adds YAML entry
```

#### Discord Channel Setup

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → "New Application"
2. **Bot** page: "Reset Token" → copy the token. Enable **Message Content Intent**
3. Disable **Public Bot** (only you should add it to servers)
4. **OAuth2** page → URL Generator: select scope `bot`, permissions: "Send Messages", "Read Message History", "View Channels"
5. Open the generated URL → select your server → authorize
6. Create a private channel on your server (e.g. `#aifred`), add the bot
7. Right-click the channel → "Copy Channel ID" (requires Developer Mode: Discord Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode)
8. In AIfred: Plugin Manager → Discord → gear icon → enter Bot Token + Channel ID → Save & Activate

#### User Management (aifred-admin CLI)

AIfred requires user authentication. Manage users via the admin CLI:

```bash
./aifred-admin users              # List whitelist (who can register)
./aifred-admin add <username>     # Add user to whitelist
./aifred-admin remove <username>  # Remove from whitelist
./aifred-admin accounts           # List registered accounts
./aifred-admin create <username> [password]   # Account + whitelist in one step (prompts for PW if omitted)
./aifred-admin delete <username>  # Delete account (with confirmation)
./aifred-admin delete <username> --sessions  # Also delete user's sessions
```

**Workflow:**
1. Admin adds username to whitelist: `./aifred-admin add alice`
2. User registers in web UI with username + password
3. User can now login from any device with their credentials

#### Service Files (Reference)

**1. ChromaDB Service** (`systemd/aifred-chromadb.service`):
```ini
[Unit]
Description=AIfred ChromaDB (Docker)
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
WorkingDirectory=/home/mp/Projekte/AIfred-Intelligence/docker
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose up -d chromadb
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker compose stop chromadb
```

**2. AIfred Intelligence Service** (`systemd/aifred-intelligence.service`):

> ℹ️ Simplified/illustrative excerpt — the shipped unit file has more
> (drop-ins, an `ExecStartPre` Reflex patch, extra environment). Always
> deploy the real file via `sudo ./scripts/install-services.sh`, which
> substitutes the `__USER__`/`__PROJECT_DIR__` placeholders for you.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=AIfred Intelligence Voice Assistant (Reflex Version)
After=network.target ollama.service aifred-chromadb.service
Wants=ollama.service aifred-chromadb.service

[Service]
Type=simple
# Optional .env file (Secrets, machine-specific overrides). The `-`
# prefix means "no error if the file is missing".
EnvironmentFile=-__PROJECT_DIR__/.env
User=__USER__
Group=__USER__
WorkingDirectory=__PROJECT_DIR__
Environment="PATH=__PROJECT_DIR__/venv/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
Environment="PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1"

```

**⚠️ Important:** Don't edit `/etc/systemd/system/` by hand — run
`sudo ./scripts/install-services.sh`, which substitutes the `__USER__`
and `__PROJECT_DIR__` placeholders for you.

#### Environment Configuration (.env)

For production/external access, create a `.env` file in the project root (this file is gitignored and NOT pushed to the repository):

```bash
# API Keys for web search (optional)
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key

# Ollama Configuration
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
# IMPORTANT: Set OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1 in Ollama service config (see Performance section below)

# Backend URL for static files (HTML Preview, Images)
# With NGINX: Leave empty or omit - NGINX routes /_upload/ to backend
# Without NGINX (dev): Set to backend URL for direct access
# BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8002

# Cloud LLM API Keys (optional - only needed if using cloud backends)
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_key_here      # Qwen (DashScope)
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here       # DeepSeek
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here      # Claude (Anthropic)
MOONSHOT_API_KEY=your_key_here       # Kimi (Moonshot)
```

**How does the frontend find the backend?**

`rxconfig.py` sets `api_url` to `http://0.0.0.0:8002`. The Reflex frontend replaces `0.0.0.0` with the hostname the page was loaded from — no URL setting needed:
- Over HTTPS (nginx) it switches to `https`/`wss` on the standard port **443** — nginx has to listen on 443 as well, even if you open the page on another port such as 8443
- Over plain HTTP (e.g. `http://<LAN-IP>:3002`) the browser talks to port **8002** on that host directly — that is why the backend listens on all interfaces (`--backend-host 0.0.0.0`)

**Why dev mode?**

AIfred runs Reflex in dev mode — there is no `--env prod` on the ExecStart line. Production mode (`reflex run --env prod`) causes a **FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)** on every page reload: React Router 7 with `prerender: true` loads the CSS asynchronously, so the HTML is visible before the Emotion CSS-in-JS arrives.

**Dev Mode Characteristics:**
- No FOUC (CSS loaded synchronously)
- Slightly higher RAM usage (hot reload server)
- More console warnings (React Strict Mode)
- Non-minified bundles (slightly larger)

For a local home network server, these drawbacks are negligible.

**Additionally required for Dev Mode with external access:**

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The `.web/vite.config.js` file gets overwritten on Reflex updates!
> Use the patch script after updates: `./scripts/patch-vite-config.sh`

In `.web/vite.config.js`, the following must be configured:

1. **allowedHosts** - for external domain access:
```javascript
server: {
  allowedHosts: ["your-domain.com", "localhost", "127.0.0.1"],
}
```

2. **proxy** - for API and TTS SSE streaming (required when accessing via frontend port 3002):
```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/_upload': { target: 'http://0.0.0.0:8002', changeOrigin: true },
    '/api': { target: 'http://0.0.0.0:8002', changeOrigin: true },
  },
}
```

Without the `/api` proxy, TTS streaming will fail with "text/html instead of text/event-stream" errors.

**Optional: Polkit Rule for Restart Without sudo**

For the restart button in the web UI without password prompt:

`/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-aifred-restart.rules`:
```javascript
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if ((action.id == "org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units") &&
        (action.lookup("unit") == "aifred-intelligence.service" ||
         action.lookup("unit") == "ollama.service") &&
        (action.lookup("verb") == "restart") &&
        (subject.user == "mp")) {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});
```

## ⚠️ Multi-User Capabilities & Limitations

AIfred is designed as a **single-user system** but supports 2-3 concurrent users with certain limitations.

### ✅ What Works (Concurrent Users)

**Session Isolation (Reflex Framework):**
- Each browser tab gets its own session with unique `client_token` (UUID)
- **Chat history is isolated** - users don't see each other's conversations
- **Streaming responses work in parallel** - each user gets their own real-time updates
- **Request queuing** - Ollama automatically queues concurrent requests internally

**Per-User Isolated State:**
- ✅ Chat history (`chat_history`, `llm_history`)
- ✅ Current messages and streaming responses
- ✅ Image uploads and crop state
- ✅ Session ID and device ID (cookie-based)
- ✅ Failed sources and debug messages

### ⚠️ What Is Shared (Global State)

**Backend Configuration (shared across all users):**
- ⚠️ **Selected backend** (Ollama, vLLM, TabbyAPI, Cloud API)
- ⚠️ **Backend URL**
- ⚠️ **Selected models** (AIfred-LLM, Automatik-LLM, Sokrates-LLM, Salomo-LLM, Vision-LLM)
- ⚠️ **Available models list**
- ⚠️ **GPU info and VRAM cache**
- ⚠️ **vLLM process manager**

**Settings File (`data/settings.json`):**
- ⚠️ All settings are global (temperature, Multi-Agent mode, RoPE factors, etc.)
- ⚠️ If User A changes a setting → User B sees the change immediately
- ⚠️ No per-user settings profiles

### 🎯 Practical Usage Scenarios

**✅ SAFE: Multiple users sending requests**
```
Timeline (Ollama automatically queues requests):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
User A: Sends question → Ollama processes → Response to User A
User B:                → Sends question → Waits in queue → Ollama processes → Response to User B
User C:                                 → Sends question → Waits in queue → Ollama processes → Response to User C
```

- Each user gets their own correct answer
- Ollama's internal queue handles concurrent requests sequentially
- No race conditions as long as nobody changes settings during requests

**⚠️ PROBLEMATIC: Changing settings during active requests**
```
User A: Sends request with Qwen3:8b → Processing...
User B: Switches model to Llama3:70b → Global state changes!
User A: Request continues with Qwen3 parameters (OK - already passed)
User A: Next request would use Llama3 (unintended)
```

- Settings changes affect all users immediately
- Running requests are safe (parameters already passed to backend)
- New requests from User A would use User B's settings

### 📊 Memory & Session Management

**Session Storage:**
- Sessions stored in RAM (plain dict by default, no Redis)
- **No automatic expiration** - sessions stay in memory until server restart
- Empty sessions are small (~1-5 KB each)
- **Not a problem**: Even 100 empty sessions = ~500 KB RAM

**Chat History:**
- Users who regularly clear their chat history keep memory usage low
- Full conversations (50+ messages) use more RAM but are manageable
- History compression (70% trigger) keeps context manageable

### 🔧 Design Rationale

**Why is backend configuration global?**

AIfred is designed for local hardware with limited resources:
- **Single GPU**: Can only run one model at a time efficiently
- **VRAM constraints**: Loading different models per user would exceed VRAM
- **Hardware is single-user oriented**: All users must share the configured backend/models

**This is intentional** - the system is optimized for:
- **Primary use case**: 1 user, occasionally 2-3 users
- **Shared hardware**: Everyone uses the same GPU/models
- **Root control**: Administrator (you) manages settings, others use the system as configured

### 🛡️ Recommendations for Multi-User Setup

1. **Establish usage rules:**
   - Designate one admin (root user) who manages settings
   - Other users should not change backend/model settings
   - Communicate when changing critical settings

2. **Safe concurrent usage:**
   - ✅ Multiple users can send requests simultaneously
   - ✅ Each user gets their own response and chat history
   - ⚠️ Avoid changing settings while others are actively using the system

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - Users see the same available models (shared dropdown)
   - Settings changes sync across browser tabs within 1-2 seconds (via `settings.json` polling)
   - **UI Sync Delay**: Model dropdown may not visually update until clicked/reopened (known Reflex limitation)
   - Multi-Agent mode and other simple settings sync immediately and visibly
   - This is **by design** for single-GPU hardware

### 🚫 What AIfred Is NOT

- ❌ **Not a multi-tenant SaaS**: No per-user accounts, quotas, or isolated resources
- ❌ **Not designed for >5 concurrent users**: Request queue would become slow
- ❌ **Not for untrusted users**: Any user can change global settings (no permissions/roles)

### ✅ What AIfred IS

- ✅ **Personal AI assistant** for home/office use
- ✅ **Family-friendly**: 2-3 family members can use it simultaneously without issues
- ✅ **Developer-focused**: Root user has full control, others use it as configured
- ✅ **Hardware-optimized**: Makes best use of single GPU for all users

**Summary**: AIfred works well for small groups (2-3 users) who coordinate settings changes, but is not suitable for large-scale multi-user deployments or untrusted user access.

```

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### Ollama: OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1 (Critical for Single-User)

**Problem:** Ollama's default `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=2` **doubles the KV-cache allocation** for an unused second parallel slot. This wastes ~50% of your GPU VRAM.

**Impact:**
- With PARALLEL=2: 30B model fits ~111K context (with CPU offload)
- With PARALLEL=1: 30B model fits ~222K context (pure GPU, no offload)

**Solution:** Set `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1` in Ollama's systemd configuration:

```bash
# Create override directory
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d/

# Create override file
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d/override.conf << 'EOF'
[Service]
Environment="OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1"
EOF

# Apply changes
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart ollama
```

**When to use PARALLEL=1:**
- Single-user setups (home server, personal workstation)
- Maximum context window needed for research/RAG tasks

**When to keep PARALLEL=2+:**
- Multi-user server with concurrent requests
- Load balancing scenarios

After changing this setting, **recalibrate your models** in the UI to take advantage of the freed VRAM.

### llama.cpp vs Ollama Performance Comparison

Benchmarks with Qwen3-30B-A3B Q8_0 on 2× Tesla P40 (48 GB VRAM total — historical measurement from the P40 era; the relative advantage carries over to newer hardware):

| Metric | llama.cpp | Ollama | Advantage |
|--------|:---------:|:------:|:---------:|
| TTFT (Time to First Token) | 1.1s | 1.5s | llama.cpp -27% |
| Generation Speed | 39.3 tok/s | 27.4 tok/s | llama.cpp +43% |
| Prompt Processing | 1,116 tok/s | 862 tok/s | llama.cpp +30% |
| Intent Detection | 0.8s | 0.7s | similar |

**When to choose llama.cpp:**
- Maximum generation speed and throughput
- Multi-GPU setups (full tensor split control)
- Large context windows (direct VRAM calibration)
- Production deployments where every tok/s counts

**When to choose Ollama:**
- Quick setup and experimentation
- Automatic model management (`ollama pull`)
- Simpler configuration for beginners

## 🔨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### HTTP ReadTimeout on Research Requests
**Problem**: `httpx.ReadTimeout` after 60 seconds on large research requests
**Solution**: Timeout is already increased to 300s in `aifred/backends/ollama.py`
**If problems persist**: Restart Ollama service with `systemctl restart ollama`

#### Service Won't Start
**Problem**: AIfred service doesn't start or stops immediately
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check logs
journalctl -u aifred-intelligence -n 50
# Check Ollama status
systemctl status ollama
```

#### Restart Button Not Working
**Problem**: Restart button in web UI has no effect
**Solution**: Check Polkit rule in `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-aifred-restart.rules`
