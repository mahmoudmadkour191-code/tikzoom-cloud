# (low/medium/high) is shared across providers but the config-dict key

# Single source of truth for which provider stores effort where:
# `AnalysisConfigKey.from_config` iterates `.values()` to read the active
# effort for the cache slug / caption / Telegraph title, so a new provider
# adding a thinking knob only needs to register its key here.
#
# Population is upstream's job. As of tradingagents v0.3.0, upstream's own
# `_ENV_OVERRIDES` maps `TRADINGAGENTS_OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT` /
# `TRADINGAGENTS_ANTHROPIC_EFFORT` / `TRADINGAGENTS_GOOGLE_THINKING_LEVEL`
# onto exactly these config keys at lib import. We previously carried a
# local `_apply_local_effort_overlay` to fill that gap (upstream <0.3.0
# didn't expose them); it was removed when the pin moved to v0.3.0 — these
# keys now arrive pre-populated and we only READ them here.
