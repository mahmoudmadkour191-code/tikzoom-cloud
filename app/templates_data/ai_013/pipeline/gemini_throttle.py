"""
pipeline/gemini_throttle.py — Shared Gemini API rate-limit throttle.
hackernews.py (HN comment parsing), telegram_channels.py (post extraction),
and scorer.py (job scoring) all call the same Gemini API key and count
toward the same 15 RPM / 1,500 RPD quota.
This module holds a single process-level timestamp so all callers share one
inter-request interval and never collide on the rate limit.
Usage:
    from pipeline.gemini_throttle import gemini_throttle
    gemini_throttle()   # blocks until it is safe to call Gemini
Rate limit math (gemini-3.1-flash-lite free tier):
    REQ_INTERVAL = 4.5 s  →  ~13.3 req/min  →  safely under 15 RPM
    HN parse        : 12 calls/run  × 4.5 s  =  ~54 s
    Telegram extract: 13 calls/run  × 4.5 s  =  ~59 s   (⌈63 posts / 5⌉)
    AI scoring      : 150 calls/run × 4.5 s  =  ~11.25 min
    Combined        : 175 calls/run × 2 runs/day = 350 RPD (of ~1,500 RPD budget)
    Each phase runs sequentially (source → scorer) so RPM never spikes.
