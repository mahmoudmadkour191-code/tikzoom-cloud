"""Ticker validation backed by yfinance — same source tradingagents reads.

Public entry point is `validate_ticker(raw)`. It normalizes case, applies the
US class-share dot→dash rewrite (`BRK.B` → `BRK-B`) when the original lookup
returns no data, and returns either a canonical symbol or a hint string the
caller can surface to the user.

Network call goes through `asyncio.to_thread` so PTB's event loop stays
responsive. Results are cached in-process with a TTL to avoid hammering Yahoo
on repeated `/add` of the same ticker (and to keep bulk-add fast).
