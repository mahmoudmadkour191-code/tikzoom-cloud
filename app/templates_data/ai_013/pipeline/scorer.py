# Google Gemini: gemini-3.1-flash-lite (free tier via AI Studio)
#
# Model history (why we're here):
#   - Groq llama-4-scout-17b  → discontinued by Groq
#   - gemini-2.5-flash        → 5 RPM + thinking tokens contaminate JSON
#   - gemini-2.0-flash        → deprecated March 2026
#   - gemini-3.1-flash-lite   → current best for high-volume free tier
#
# Why gemini-3.1-flash-lite:
#   - Generally Available (stable), released May 7 2026
#   - ~15 RPM free tier — same as old 2.0-flash, 3x more than 2.5-flash
#   - ~1,500 RPD free tier — 130 jobs/run × 2 runs = 260 RPD (well within)
#   - ~250K TPM — sufficient for our workload (13 req/min × ~2,400 tok = 31K)
#   - JSON mode (response_mime_type=application/json) works cleanly —
#     thinking output is properly suppressed in structured output mode
#   - 1M token context window, 64K output limit
#   - Optimised for high-throughput, cost-sensitive use cases
#
# Confirmed free-tier limits (verify in Google AI Studio):
#   RPM  ≈ 15 requests / minute
#   RPD  ≈ 1,500 requests / day
#   TPM  ≈ 250,000 tokens / minute
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MODEL        = "gemini-3.1-flash-lite"
REQ_INTERVAL = 4.5        # seconds between scoring calls
                           # 60s / 4.5 = 13.3 req/min → safely under 15 RPM.
                           # TPM: 13.3 req/min × ~2,400 tok = 31K TPM —
                           # well within the ~250K TPM free-tier limit.
_last_call_ts = 0.0        # module-level timestamp tracker

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# RATE SYSTEM (Gemini free tier)
#
# Gemini's generous TPD/TPM means the OLD two-layer token budget
# system is no longer needed. The ONLY binding constraint is RPM.
#
# Old approach (Groq): token budget guard stopped scoring at ~103
#   jobs because 103 × 1,930 tok = 199K ≈ 200K per-run ceiling.
#   The last 27 ranked jobs were skipped every single run.
#
# New approach (Gemini): remove TOKEN_BUDGET_PER_RUN as a hard cap.
#   All jobs up to max_ai_jobs_per_run (130) are scored.
#   Rate control is purely via the 4.5s inter-request interval.
#   A 150-job run takes ~11 min — acceptable per user preference.
#
# Per-job cost estimate (Gemini, 7K char desc + thinking_budget=256):
#   System prompt + few-shot : ~2,000 tokens (richer rubric + more examples)
#   User prompt (profile+JD) : ~1,900 tokens average (7K chars ÷ 4)
#   Thinking tokens (hidden) : ~256 tokens (internal reasoning, not in output)
#   Response (full reason)   :  ~600 tokens (richer structured output)
#   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Total per job            : ~4,756 tokens (estimated)
#   150 jobs × 4,756 tok     : ~713,400 tokens/run
#   × 2 runs/day             : ~1,427K TPD → 95% of 1,500K TPD budget
#   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Conservative: thinking_budget=256 (cap, not guarantee — typical ~150-250)
#   If TPD limits hit: reduce DESC_CHAR_LIMIT to 6000 or thinking_budget to 128
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SYSTEM_PROMPT_TOKENS  = 2000     # ~2,000 tokens (richer rubric + 8 few-shot examples)
RESPONSE_TOKENS       = 856      # ~600 response + ~256 thinking (both count toward TPM/TPD)
CHARS_PER_TOKEN       = 4        # standard approximation (1 token ≈ 4 chars)
DESC_CHAR_LIMIT       = 7000     # Expanded from 6000 — covers longer Naukri/Internshala JDs
                                  # where stipend, batch year, and stack appear late in text.
                                  # Cost: ~250 extra tok/job — well within TPM/TPD budget.

# FEW-SHOT CALIBRATION EXAMPLES
#
# Purpose: anchor the 1–10 scale so Gemini doesn't drift.
# Five calibration examples injected into the SYSTEM prompt.
#
# Critical design choices:
#   - Score-9 example is NOT Go-exclusive: TypeScript/Node.js backend
#     internships are the majority of available fresher roles in India.
#     Over-anchoring on Go causes all TS/Node roles to land at 5–6
#     instead of 7–8, producing 0 urgents per run.
#   - Full 5-level bracket: 9 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 3
#     Without mid-range anchors (5, 6, 7), the model collapses
#     ambiguous cases to 3–4 (as seen in v4 run: 0 urgents).
#   - Market context is explicit: India Go fresher roles are rare
#     in July 2026 — score relative to what's realistically available.

## CALIBRATION EXAMPLES (use these to anchor your scoring scale)

### Example A — Score 9 (near-perfect match)
Job: "Backend Engineering Intern" at a fintech startup (India/Remote)
Description excerpt: "Build REST APIs and microservices. Stack: Go or TypeScript.
  0–1 years experience. Stipend ₹20,000–30,000/month. 2026/2027 batch welcome."
Dimension analysis: [A] backend engineering ✓ [B] intern/fresher ✓ [C] Go/TS +2 [D] India/Remote ✓
  [E] fintech +2 [F] startup known ✓ [G] stipend ₹20K+ meets minimum ✓ [H] active ✓
→ Correct score: 9
→ Reasoning: Backend intern role in a relevant domain (fintech), remote/India acceptable,
  fresher-friendly, primary stack. Stipend meets minimum. Target archetype — score at 9.
→ apply_urgency: "high"

### Example B — Score 7 (good non-Go backend role)
Job: "Backend Intern (Node.js/TypeScript)" at an Indian SaaS startup, Bangalore/Remote
Description excerpt: "0–6 months experience required. Build REST APIs using Express/Node.js.
  TypeScript preferred. Stipend ₹20,000–30,000/month."
Dimension analysis: [A] backend engineering ✓ [B] intern 0-6mo ✓ [C] TypeScript +1 [D] India ✓
  [E] SaaS +1 [F] startup ✓ [G] stipend ₹20K+ ✓ [H] active ✓
→ Correct score: 7
→ Reasoning: TypeScript backend is in candidate's strong stack, India location, fresher-friendly.
  Not Go or fintech so not a 9. Must not be scored below 7 — this is a genuinely good match.
→ apply_urgency: "medium"

### Example C — Score 6 (solid adjacent, should surface in digest)
Job: "Graduate Software Engineer" at a remote-first company (Python/Kafka)
Description excerpt: "Any location accepted. 2026/2027 batch welcome. Backend focused,
  Python, REST APIs, message queues. 0 experience required."
Dimension analysis: [A] SWE role ✓ [B] graduate/fresher ✓ [C] Python (backend) 0 [D] remote ✓
  [E] neutral 0 [F] remote-first ✓ [G] not mentioned, benefit of doubt [H] active ✓
→ Correct score: 6
→ Reasoning: Remote-first and fresh-batch are strong positives. Python is not primary stack
  but role is backend-adjacent, entry-level. Worth a digest — do not score lower than 6.
→ apply_urgency: "medium"

### Example D — Score 4 (unpaid — hard compensation cap)
Job: "Full Stack Developer Internship" at an Indian startup, Bangalore
Description excerpt: "No specific experience required. Build REST APIs and UI components.
  Unpaid internship / no stipend. Great learning opportunity."
Dimension analysis: [A] full-stack ✓ [B] intern ✓ [C] React+Node mixed [D] India ✓
  [E] neutral [F] unknown startup [G] UNPAID — hard cap: max score 4 ✗
→ Correct score: 4
→ Reasoning: Unpaid internship — candidate's stated minimum is ₹10,000/month. Compensation
  disqualifier hard-caps this at 4 regardless of other signals.
→ apply_urgency: "low"

### Example E — Score 2 (aggregate listing page, not a real job)
Job: "50+ TypeScript Jobs in India - Cutshort" at Cutshort
Description excerpt: "Browse hundreds of TypeScript jobs on Cutshort. Filter by..."
Dimension analysis: [A] NOT a job posting — it is a search/listing page ✗
→ Correct score: 2
→ Reasoning: This is a job board aggregator page, not an individual job posting.
  No company, no description, no application details. Score 2 regardless of title keywords.
→ apply_urgency: "low"

### Example F — Score 3 (talent pipeline form — not a real open role)
Job: "Talent Pipeline - Product Engineering" at a SaaS company
Description excerpt: "Not an active job posting. Submit your details to be considered
  for future Product Engineering openings as they arise."
Dimension analysis: [A] engineering team ✓ [B] unclear [C] unclear [D] unclear
  [E] SaaS [F] known company [G] unclear [H] NOT AN ACTIVE ROLE — talent pipeline ✗
→ Correct score: 3
→ Reasoning: Talent pipelines are not open positions — no active hiring, no timeline,
  no guaranteed interview. Score 3 max; candidate's time is better spent on active postings.
→ apply_urgency: "low"

### Example G — Score 1 (hard reject: wrong role type)
Job: "Sales Engineer" at a US-only SaaS company
Description excerpt: "3+ years experience in B2B SaaS sales required. Drive revenue
  through technical demos and client presentations. Must be based in USA."
Dimension analysis: [A] SALES, not backend engineering ✗ [B] 3+ yrs ✗ [C] N/A
  [D] USA on-site only ✗ [E] SaaS [F] known [G] unclear [H] active
→ Correct score: 1
→ Reasoning: Sales Engineer is a revenue/customer-facing role, not software engineering.
  Additionally requires 3+ years and US-only location. Triple disqualification.
→ apply_urgency: "low"

### Example H — Score 5 (borderline — backend adjacent, weak signals)
Job: "Full Stack Developer Intern (React + Node.js)" at Indian startup, Bangalore
Description excerpt: "No specific experience required. Build UI components and
  REST APIs. Bangalore office only. Stipend ₹15,000/month."
Dimension analysis: [A] full-stack ✓ [B] intern ✓ [C] Node.js +1 but React-heavy [D] India ✓
  [E] neutral [F] small startup [G] stipend ₹15K ≥ min ✓ [H] active ✓
→ Correct score: 5
→ Reasoning: Full-stack role with frontend-heavy framing. Backend component (REST APIs,
  Node.js) exists but React is the primary focus. Save to DB but no notification.
→ apply_urgency: "low"

## SCORING TASK

Evaluate the job below using this structured approach:

### STEP 1 — DIMENSION ANALYSIS (evaluate each before scoring)

Work through every dimension and determine its signal:

[A] ROLE TYPE — Is this actually a backend/SWE/engineering role?
    PASS signals: backend, SDE, software engineer, full-stack, platform, infrastructure
    FAIL signals: sales engineer, solutions engineer, customer engineer, GTM engineer,
      forward deployed engineer, customer success, business development, HR, analyst,
      designer, operations, QA tester, data scientist, ML engineer, security analyst
    → If FAIL: hard cap score ≤ 2

[B] SENIORITY — Is this genuinely fresher/entry-level/intern?
    PASS: intern, fresher, junior, associate, 0–1 year, entry level, graduate trainee,
      2026/2027 batch, accelerator program (e.g. Binance Accelerator)
    FAIL: 2+ years required, senior, lead, staff, principal, architect, head of, director
    → If FAIL: hard cap score ≤ 3

[C] STACK FIT — How well does the stack match candidate's skills?
    +3: Go/Golang explicitly required or preferred
    +2: TypeScript backend, Node.js backend (as primary, not just mentioned)
    +1: Python backend, Rust, gRPC, microservices-heavy
     0: Java, C#, Scala, other backend languages
    -1: Primarily frontend (React, Vue, Angular) with backend as secondary
    -2: No backend at all, or irrelevant stack

[D] LOCATION — Is the location acceptable?
    PASS: India (any city), Remote, WFH, Worldwide, Anywhere
    FAIL: USA only / UK only / Europe only / on-site outside India with no remote option
    → If FAIL: hard cap score ≤ 2

[E] DOMAIN — Company/industry relevance?
    +2: Fintech, crypto, payments, blockchain, trading, banking tech
    +1: SaaS, developer tools, infrastructure, API-first, e-commerce backend, cybersecurity
     0: Generic tech, e-commerce, media, gaming
    -1: Consulting/staffing/outsourcing firms (body shops)

[F] COMPENSATION — Does it meet the candidate's stated minimum?
    PASS: stipend mentioned and ≥ ₹10,000/month, OR full-time with CTC ≥ ₹4 LPA,
          OR compensation not mentioned (benefit of doubt)
    FAIL: explicitly UNPAID or "no stipend" or "volunteer basis"
    → If FAIL: hard cap score ≤ 4 (non-negotiable — candidate has a stated minimum)

[G] POSTING TYPE — Is this an actual job opening?
    PASS: Individual job posting with application link, role description, responsibilities
    FAIL: Aggregate listing page ("50+ jobs on Cutshort"), talent pipeline
          ("submit for future consideration"), closed/expired posting, category page
    → If FAIL: score ≤ 3 (aggregate page ≤ 2, talent pipeline ≤ 3)

[H] EXPIRY — Is the posting still active?
    Check for: application closed, hiring closed, position filled, no longer accepting,
    deadline has passed, last date was [past date]
    → If FAIL: score=1, expired=true, apply_urgency="expired"

[I] PROJECT RELEVANCE — Do candidate's projects match this role?
    +2: Zaraba (crypto exchange) relevant to fintech/crypto/trading/high-perf systems
    +2: Sentinel-Proxy relevant to security/infrastructure/proxy/monitoring
    +1: JobRadar relevant to data pipeline/automation/API integration roles
    +1: CipherBin relevant to web/Go/PostgreSQL roles
     0: No project relevance

### STEP 2 — COMBINE DIMENSIONS → FINAL SCORE

Use the dimension scores above to determine the final score:
- 9–10: Strong PASS on [A][B][C][D], bonus domain/stack, great company
- 7–8 : PASS on [A][B], good stack fit, India/remote confirmed
- 5–6 : PASS on [A], weak or mixed stack, adjacent role
- 3–4 : Some relevance but key dimension(s) fail (wrong stack, unpaid, weak role type)
- 1–2 : Hard fail on [A] or [D] or [G] or [H], or aggregate/pipeline/wrong-role

**Market calibration**: Go/backend fresher roles in India are rare.
A TypeScript/Node.js backend intern with India/Remote + 0-exp signals should score 7–8.

Mandatory score thresholds from STEP 1 apply BEFORE final score assignment.

### STEP 3 — OUTPUT (JSON only, no markdown)

Return ONLY a valid JSON object:
{{
  "score": <integer 1-10>,
  "expired": <true if [H] triggered, false otherwise>,
  "reason": "<1-3 sentences: key dimension results + primary factor for the score — MANDATORY for ALL scores>",

  "red_flags": ["<concern 1>", "<concern 2> — required if score>=6, else []"],
  "golang_match": <true if Go/Golang mentioned in JD, false otherwise>,
  "fintech_match": <true if fintech/crypto/payments company, false otherwise>,
  "apply_urgency": "<high (score 8-10) / medium (score 6-7) / low (score 1-5) / expired>",
  "estimated_experience_required": "<0 / 0-1 / 1-2 / unknown>"

      3. AI scoring                   — all capped jobs scored (no token budget gate).

    Why no token budget gate:
      Gemini free tier provides ~1M TPM and ~1.5M TPD. At ~3,500 tokens/job
      and 130 jobs/run, total cost is ~455K tokens — well within limits even
      for 3 runs/day. The old 200K per-run token ceiling caused 27 jobs to be
      skipped every run. With Gemini, all ranked jobs are scored.

    Why ranking before scoring:
      Jobs without a posted_at date used to be silently dropped because the
      old approach sorted by date. Now recency is one signal among many —
      a strong Go/fintech job with no date beats a weak dated job.

    Args:
        jobs:     Pre-filtered job dicts to score.
        profile:  Loaded profile dict.  If None, loaded from default path.
        db_path:  Path to the SQLite database.  If None, uses db.py default.

    Returns: (urgent_jobs [8-10], digest_jobs [6-7], low_jobs [<6])
    Expired jobs (urgency='expired' or expired=True) are excluded from all
    buckets and never notified or persisted.
