"""Pipeline registry — single source of truth for active inference pipelines.

Tracks the currently running ``asyncio.Task`` per session so that an external
stop command (FreeEcho.2 wake-word ``_stop``, browser stop button, future Discord
``/stop``-slash, …) can cancel the pipeline cleanly.

Design notes
------------
* One task per session — if a new pipeline starts while an old one is still
  registered, the old one is cancelled (last-write-wins; the user's newest
  request takes priority).
* The registry only stores ``asyncio.Task`` references — cancellation
  propagates naturally through ``await`` points to LLM streaming, tool calls,
  TTS generation, web-research, etc.
* ``handle_stop_command(session_id)`` is the public entry point and is
  channel-agnostic: FreeEcho.2 channel, Browser-UI button, future channels all
  call it. Single mechanism, single side-effects (cancel + audio stop).

Limitations
-----------
* Audio buffers already streamed to the FreeEcho.2/Browser cannot be revoked from
  here — that's the device's job. The FreeEcho.2 plugin instance handles its local
  buffer drain on its side; this server-side function only stops generating
  *new* output.
