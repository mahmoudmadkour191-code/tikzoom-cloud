"""Backend-neutral projection of multiplexer windows onto Telegram topics.

Consumes the multiplexer seam; it is **not** part of the ``Multiplexer``
contract (which stops at opaque ``window_id``). It defines how a backend's
windows/tabs project onto ccgram's flat ``group → topic`` structure.

The design maps each reported Herdr agent to one Telegram topic. Herdr
``WindowRef.window_id`` is an opaque target, never a raw tab, pane, or other
locator. A published agent session has a durable target; a sessionless detected
agent does not become a topic. A bare shell record does not become a topic, and
raw locator aliases are never auto-migrated. tmux behavior remains unchanged.

Lives in ``multiplexer/`` (not ``handlers/``) so both the core session monitor
and the topic handlers can import it without crossing the F1 boundary, and
because it is pure logic over the neutral value types.

    The backend decides, in ``WindowRef.topic_eligible``. No capability flag

    permanently ineligible the moment agterm began reporting status natively;
    keying it on ``native_topic_targets`` instead only moved the overload onto
    a flag whose documented meaning is which creation flow to use.

    Only the backend can answer this. herdr knows a record carries a guarded
    target and an agent label, agterm knows its workspace scope and how to read
    a wrapped argv, and tmux excludes only the placeholder main window, its
    own, and the ``_``-prefixed ones its complete listing marks ineligible
    instead of dropping. ``caps`` stays in the signature
