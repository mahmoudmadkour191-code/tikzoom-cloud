**Bot on Anything** is a lightweight framework for building AI chatbots. With a bit of configuration you can connect various large models to different application channels — a great fit for quickly spinning up bots on overseas channels like Telegram, Slack, Discord, and Gmail.

> Need a more complete Agent — task planning, long-term memory, skills, MCP, self-evolution and more? Check out our other project **[CowAgent](https://github.com/zhayujie/CowAgent)**. See [Related Projects](#related-projects).

<br/>

## Introduction

With a single config file, you pick one connection between a large model and an application channel, get a chatbot running, and switch between different paths anytime within the same project. Models and channels are independent: adding a channel reuses existing models, and adding a model works across all channels.

<br/>

## 🌟 Highlights

| Capability | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Multiple models | OpenAI (GPT-5.5 / GPT-4.1, etc.), LinkAI (one key for 100+ models: DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini...), ERNIE Bot, New Bing, Bard — switch by changing the `type` field |
| Multiple channels | Terminal, Web, WeChat Subscription / Service Account, Enterprise WeChat, QQ, Telegram, Gmail, Slack, DingTalk, Feishu, Discord — 12 channels |
| Decoupled models & channels | Models and channels are not bound together; any model runs on any channel, and adding one side reuses the other |
| Parallel channels | List multiple channels in one config and start them together as separate processes without interference |
| Plugin support | Compatible with the plugin model of [chatgpt-on-wechat](https://github.com/zhayujie/CowAgent/tree/master/plugins) — extend with image generation, model selectors, and more |
| Lightweight deploy | Pure Python, runs with just a few lines of config |

<br/>

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Runtime Environment

Works on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Python is required — version 3.7.1~3.10 is recommended.

Clone the code and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhayujie/bot-on-anything
cd bot-on-anything/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration

The core config file is `config.json`. The project ships with a template `config-template.json` — just copy it to get the actual config:

```bash
cp config-template.json config.json
```

Each model and channel has its own config block, which together form the full config file. The overall structure looks like this:

```bash
{
  "model": {
    "type" : "openai",             # the AI model to use
    "openai": {
      # openAI config
    }
  },
  "channel": {
    "type": "slack",            # the channel to connect
    "slack": {
        # slack config
    },
    "telegram": {
        # telegram config
    }
  }
}
```

At the top level the config splits into `model` and `channel`: `model` is the model config, whose `type` picks which model to use; `channel` is the channel config, whose `type` picks which channel to connect (it can also be an array to start several channels at once).

Day to day, you just change these two `type` fields to switch between different models and channels. Each model and channel is described below, with configuration and how to run it (click to expand).

### 3. Running

Run the following in the project root — the default channel is the terminal:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

## 🤖 Models

| Model | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [OpenAI](#openai) | Works with the OpenAI-compatible chat API — GPT-5.5 / GPT-4.1 and other models, or any compatible gateway via `api_base` |
| [LinkAI](#linkai) | One key for 100+ models including DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, GLM, and more |
| [ERNIE Bot](#ernie-bot) | Based on Baidu ERNIE Bot's web version |
| [New Bing](#new-bing) | Based on Bing chat, supports jailbreak mode |
| [Bard](#bard) | Based on Google Bard's web version |

> For models from other providers (DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini...), use **LinkAI** — one key covers them all — or [CowAgent](https://github.com/zhayujie/CowAgent).

<a id="openai"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>OpenAI</b></summary>

Uses the OpenAI-compatible chat API. Set `model` to any model your endpoint supports (e.g. `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-4.1`), or point `api_base` to a compatible gateway to use other providers. See the [official docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) for details.

**Install dependencies**

```bash
pip3 install "openai<1.0.0"
```
> Note: this project uses the legacy `openai` SDK (`0.27.x`+ but below `1.0.0`) — `requirements.txt` already pins a compatible version. If installation fails, upgrade pip first with `pip3 install --upgrade pip`.

**Configuration**

```bash
{
  "model": {
    "type" : "chatgpt",
    "openai": {
      "api_key": "YOUR API KEY",
      "api_base": "",                                   # optional, an OpenAI-compatible endpoint
      "model": "gpt-5.5",                               # model name
      "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:7890",                 # proxy address
      "character_desc": "You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI...",
      "conversation_max_tokens": 1000,                  # max reply length, total of input and output
      "temperature":0.75,     # entropy in [0,1]; higher means more random word choices
      "top_p":0.7,            # candidate word list; 0.7 means only the top 70% of candidates are considered
      "frequency_penalty":0.0,            # in [-2,2]; higher reduces word repetition in a line
      "presence_penalty":1.0,             # in [-2,2]; higher is less constrained by the input
    }
}
```
+ `api_key`: the `OpenAI API KEY` created when you registered your account
+ `api_base` (optional): an OpenAI-compatible endpoint; leave empty for the official API, or point it to a compatible gateway to use other providers
+ `model`: any model your endpoint supports, e.g. `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o` (GPT-5 / o-series only accept default sampling params; this project skips them automatically)
+ `proxy`: proxy client address, see [#56](https://github.com/zhayujie/bot-on-anything/issues/56)
+ `character_desc`: the bot's persona; the model plays this role, feel free to customize it
+ `max_history_num` (optional): max length of conversation memory; older memory is cleared beyond this

</details>

<a id="web"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>Web</b></summary>

**Contributor:** [RegimenArsenic](https://github.com/RegimenArsenic)

**Dependencies**

```bash
pip3 install PyJWT flask flask_socketio
```

**Configuration**

```bash
"channel": {
    "type": "http",
    "http": {
      "http_auth_secret_key": "6d25a684-9558-11e9-aa94-efccd7a0659b",    // JWT auth secret key
      "http_auth_password": "6.67428e-11",        // auth password, for personal use, a basic defense against port scanning and DDOS wasting tokens
      "port": "80"       // port
    }
  }
```

Run locally: after `python3 app.py`, visit `http://127.0.0.1:80`.

Run on a server: after deploying, visit `http://your-domain-or-IP:port`.

</details>

<a id="subscription-account"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>Subscription Account</b></summary>

**Requirements:** a server and a subscription account.

**1. Install dependencies**

Install [werobot](https://github.com/offu/WeRoBot):

```bash
pip3 install werobot
```

**2. Configuration**

```bash
"channel": {
    "type": "wechat_mp",
    "wechat_mp": {
      "token": "YOUR TOKEN",           # token value
      "port": "8088"                   # port the program listens on
    }
}
```

**3. Run the program**

Run `python3 app.py` in the project directory. If the terminal shows the following, it started successfully:

```
[INFO][2023-02-16 01:39:53][app.py:12] - [INIT] load config: ...
[INFO][2023-02-16 01:39:53][wechat_mp_channel.py:25] - [WX_Public] Wechat Public account service start!
Bottle v0.12.23 server starting up (using AutoServer())...
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8088/
Hit Ctrl-C to quit.
```

**4. Set the callback URL**

Go to your subscription account in the [WeChat Official Platform](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/) and enable server configuration:

![wx_mp_config.png](images/wx_mp_config.png)

**Server address (URL)**: if you can reach the program on your server through this URL in a browser (default port 8088), the config is valid. Since subscription accounts only allow ports 80/443, either make the program listen on port 80 directly (needs sudo) or forward it with a reverse proxy like nginx. A public IP or a domain both work here.

**Token**: must match the token in `config.json`.

For the detailed process, see the [official docs](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/offiaccount/Getting_Started/Getting_Started_Guide.html).

> Note: after a user sends a message, WeChat pushes it to the configured URL, but if there's no reply within 5 seconds it disconnects and retries 3 times, while model requests often take longer than 5s. This project uses async and caching to stretch the limit to 15s, but beyond that it still can't reply in time. For time-sensitive scenarios, use the "Service Account" instead.

</details>

<a id="service-account"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>Service Account</b></summary>

**Requirements:** a server and a WeChat-verified service account.

The service account calls the model asynchronously first, then pushes the result to the user via the customer-service API, which gets around the subscription account's 15s timeout. Its developer-mode config is similar to the subscription account's — see the [official docs](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/offiaccount/Getting_Started/Getting_Started_Guide.html).

In the config, just change `type` to `wechat_mp_service`, keep reusing the `wechat_mp` block, and add `app_id` and `app_secret`:

```bash
"channel": {
    "type": "wechat_mp_service",
    "wechat_mp": {
      "token": "YOUR TOKEN",            # token value
      "port": "8088",                   # port the program listens on
      "app_id": "YOUR APP ID",          # app ID
      "app_secret": "YOUR APP SECRET"   # app secret
    }
}
```

> Note: add the server IP to the "IP whitelist", otherwise users won't receive pushed messages.

</details>

<a id="qq"></a>
<details>
<summary><b>QQ</b></summary>

**Requirements:** a PC or server (mainland China network) and a QQ account.

Running a QQ bot also needs a separate `go-cqhttp` process, which handles sending and receiving QQ messages, while this project requests the model and generates replies.

**1. Download go-cqhttp**

Download the build for your system from the [go-cqhttp Release](https://github.com/Mrs4s/go-cqhttp/releases), unzip it, and put the `go-cqhttp` binary in `bot-on-anything/channel/qq`. There's already a `config.yml` there — just fill in your QQ account (account-uin).

**2. Install aiocqhttp**

Use [aiocqhttp](https://github.com/nonebot/aiocqhttp) to talk to go-cqhttp:

```bash
pip3 install aiocqhttp
```

**3. Configuration**

Just change the channel `type` in `config.json` to `qq`:

```bash
"channel": {
    "type": "qq"
}
```

**4. Running**

Terminal 1, in the project root (listens on port 8080):

```bash
python3 app.py
```

Terminal 2, in the `go-cqhttp` directory:

```bash
cd channel/qq
./go-cqhttp
```

> Note: there's no keyword matching or group whitelist yet, so all private chats get auto-replies, and in group chats it replies whenever it's @-mentioned. If you hit issues like a frozen account, change `protocol` in `device.json` from 5 to 2, see this [Issue](https://github.com/Mrs4s/go-cqhttp/issues/1942).
